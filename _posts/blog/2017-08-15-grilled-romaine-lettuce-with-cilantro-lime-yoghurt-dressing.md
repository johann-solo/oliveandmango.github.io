Hope the grills are still hot you guys cause this grilled romaine lettuce is just the change you want in a salad. Still on the crisp side but with a brilliant smokiness. The dressing gives it a lovely little fresh zing and it's also the easiest thing to make on the grill!

The best part of it is that I used locally brown romaine lettuce. The variety I found is slightly more delicate than the usual romaine you get at the grocery store so it didn't stand up as well to the heat but that didn't change the taste of it and it still had some crunch.

I totally love taking advantage of produce that is locally grown as opposed to getting foreign stuff when I can. Not just because of it being like three times the price but the locally grown stuff is going farm to table in days so it's a lot fresher and more nutrient dense.

This recipe is perfect with any kind of romaine lettuce and I hope you give it a go. I used Amare probiotics goat yoghurt for the dressing and loved it but you most definitely can use plain regular or Greek yoghurt.

About this dressing. You can also whizz up all the Ingredients for it in a food processor or blender for a greener dressing but I left it as is and both ways would be perfectly delicious! Hope you enjoy this simple way of prepping salad! The perfect side to all your grilled goodies!

### Ingredients

**For the lettuce**

* 2 heads of romaine lettuce cleaned and spun dried
* 2-3 tbsp of olive oil

**For the dressing**

* 1 cup of Greek​ yoghurt (I used Amare probiotics goat milk yoghurt)
* ¼ cup of cilantro finely chopped
* 1 clove garlic grated
* Juice of 1 lime
* Salt and pepper to taste

### Directions

1. Combine all the ingredients for the dressing and set aside as is but if you would like a more green dressing then process all the ingredients in a food processor or intensify the colour and flavour of the cilantro
2. Heat up your grill to medium/high
3. Cut the romaine hearts in half if they are large or leave as is if they are small and on the thinner side
4. Drizzle the romaine with olive oil and grill cut side down for about 5 minutes or so until the edges are wilted and charred
5. Grill the lime cut side down as well for a few minutes to give it a smoky flavour.
6. Plate the romaine, squeeze ​juice from the grilled limes and sprinkle with salt and pepper and serve with the cilantro like dressing
