* &frac14; cup of cilantro finely chopped 

* 1 clove garlic grated 

* Juice of 1 lime 

* Salt and pepper to taste 

### Directions 

1. Combine all the ingredients for the dressing and set aside as is but if you would like a more green dressing then process all the ingredients in a food processor or intensify the colour and flavour of the cilantro 

1. Heat up your grill to medium/high

1. Cut the romaine hearts in half if they are large or leave as is if they are small and on the thinner side

1. Drizzle the romaine with olive oil and grill cut side down for about 5 minutes or so until the edges are wilted and charred 

1. Grill the lime cut side down as well for a few minutes to give it a smoky flavour. 

1. Plate the romaine, squeeze with juice from the grilled limes and sprinkle with salt and pepper and serve with the cilantro like dressing
