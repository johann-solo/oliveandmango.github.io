* &frac14; cup melted butter plus more if needed for mixture to be moistened 

* &frac12; cup sweetened flaked coconut

* &frac14; cup cornstarch
* 1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract
* 2 large eggs

### Directions 

1. Cream Cheese Filling: Place one 8-ounce package of the cream cheese, 1/3 cup of the sugar, and the cornstarch in a large bowl. 
2. Beat with an electric mixer on low until creamy, about 3 minutes, then beat in the remaining 3 packages of the cream cheese. 
3. Increase the mixer speed to high and beat in the remaining 1 1/3 cups of the sugar, then beat in the vanilla. 
4. Blend in the eggs, one at a time, beating the batter well after each one. 
5. Blend in heavy cream, lime zest and lime juice. At this point mix the filling only until completely blended. Be careful not to overmix the batter. 
6. Gently spoon the cheese filling on top of the baked crust layer. 
7. Place the springform pan in a large shallow pan containing hot water that comes about 1 inch up the side of the pan. 
8. Bake the cheesecake until the centre barely jiggles when you shake the pan, about 1 hour. 
9. Cool the cake on a wire rack for 1 hour. 
10. Then cover the cake with plastic wrap and refrigerate until it’s completely cold, at least 4 hours or overnight. 
11. Remove the sides of the springform pan.Slide the cake off of the bottom of the pan onto a serving plate. Or, if you wish, simply leave the cake on the removable bottom of the pan and place it on a serving plate.
