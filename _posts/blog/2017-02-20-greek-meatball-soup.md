excerpt: "<p>Warm your soul with this Greek comfort soup</p>"

First I just wanted to say to my fellow Canadians that I hope you had a wonderful family day!! Whether you were with your family or not, hope you had a restful beautiful day. Wish I was there to spend the day with my family but in a way I did. I got to spend the whole day with my other half today so I guess that counts for family right?!?! So I shouldn't complain.

This recipe comes from a warm and fuzzy place in my heart! I remember coming home from school on a cold day and smelling this soup going on the stove top and hearing my mom beating the eggs in a bowl while I took off wet boots and snow pants. Total comfort food. I didn’t quite get the whole egg and lemon thing at the time but I loved it.  
<br>

So what's with the egg and lemon sauce? Well that is a Greek sauce called avgolemono and it's added to soups like this one and also my favourite classic chicken and rice soup and other soups like Magiritsa which is a lamb offal soup.  It's also added to our Greek version of stuffed cabbage rolls and also a fabulous stew we also make with pork and brussell sprouts and or celery (I will be making some of those soon). Just divine!! I love anything citrus especially lemon so I would never omit the sauce from this dish. It really makes the dish and adds a delicious dimension to it and any other dish you add it too. It also gives me comfort feels because whenever anyone in the house was sick growing up that was the first thing that got made.  A hearty chicken broth with avgolemono was the remedy.

It's hearty, filling and really simple to make! The flavours are simple and delicate that is why I like to add in some extra veggies to the broth and season the meatballs well. Feel free to add even more veggies like potatoes or even some zucchini. Hope you enjoy this Greek classic as much as I do which will fill your belly with warmth and satisfaction!!

## Ingredients
<br>

### For the meatballs:

* 1 lb. of ground beef
* 1 egg
* 1/4 cup of a mixture of fresh mint, parsley and dill (chopped finely)
* 1 tsp dried oregano
* 1 onion diced finely
* 2 garlic cloves minced
* 1 tbsp EVOO
* 1/2 cup of arborio rice (or any type of rice but I have always had it with arborio)
* Salt and pepper according to preference
* 1/4 cup of flour for dusting

### For the soup:

* 2-3 tbsp of EVOO
* 2 carrots sliced
* 2 ribs of celery chopped
* 1 onion chopped
* 1 clove of garlic minced
* 6-8 cups of water or broth
* 1/4 cup of arborio rice
* Salt and pepper to taste
<br>

### For egg/lemon sauce (avgolemono)
* 1 egg
* Juice of one lemon

* if your making an extra large pot or you want it more lemony just double the egg and lemon juice
<br>

## Directions

1. Heat up 1 tbsp of oil in a small frying pan on medium heat and fry up the onion and garlic for a few minutes until soft, remove from heat and set aside to cool (you can add the onion and garlic raw but i just prefer doing this to make sure the onion is fully cooked through and no crunchy bits in the meatballs later)

1. In a large bowl combine the meat, herbs, rice, egg and the onion and garlic and oil from pan and gently mix by hand until all ingredients are incorporated into meat evenly. Do not overwork so that the meatballs will be tender and not tough. Roll into medium sized meatballs

1. Put the flour in a shallow bowl and dust the meatballs with a coating of flour (optional- helps keep the meatballs stay together a little better and adds to the thickening of soup) and set aside.

1. In a large soup pot add the remaining amount of oil and heat to medium. Add in all the veggies including the onion and sauté for approx. 10 min until they are a little softer then add in the garlic and sauté for another minute and then add the stock or water

1. Bring the pot to boil and then turn down a little to a simmer.  

1. Gently add in meatballs so as to not splatter hot broth on you and let them simmer for 20-30 minutes stirring gently occasionally.  

1. During the last ten minutes add the arborio rice to the soup and stir gently

1. Once everything is cooked through and vegetables are tender, remove about half cup of broth with a ladle into a bowl and take the soup
off the heat  

1. In a small bowl whisk the egg well until frothy and then pour in the lemon juice slowly while continuing to whisk. While continuing to whisk
Slowly add in the broth as well and this will help temper the egg so that it doesn't cook or curdle when added into the pot of soup

1. While stirring the soup in the pot very slowly start to pour in the egg lemon mixture and then you will see the magic happen! Hahah! The soup will go from a clear broth to a creamy cloudy broth. Some people add a bit of flour to the egg lemon sauce to thicken the soup
but I prefer it to be a little on the 'brothy' side and I find it gets thick enough with the addition of the rice as well so it's up to you.  

*  the egg is not, raw it cooks with the acidity of the lemon and heat of the soup in case you were wondering and is stabilised by starch in the rice
