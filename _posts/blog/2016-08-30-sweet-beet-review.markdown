excerpt: <p>The Sweet Beet for a healthy treat</p>
---

It makes me super proud to see young people with big ideas succeed in a meaningful and big way. In just a few years the founders of the the Sweet Beet Juice Company have turned a business from the kitchen to a busy store front in Westmall.
<br><br>

Their ideas and philosophies stem from their personal health and wellness goals and inspired by travel and others on social media who share their same philosophies on good clean eating. Nourishing the soul with  the freshest ingredients whether it be local when available or imported. They use local honey as an option to sweeten or agave and even use local cocoa.
<br>

> Youâ€™re in the wrong place if you want high sugar drinks and snacks. If you want a place where you can get food and drinks that feed and nourish your body with the freshest ingredients than this place will not disappoint!

One particular thing I love about their food and drinks is that they make a lot of the add ons themselves. For example, they make their own nut butters, nut milks, cashew cream and granola (the granola and shaved coconut is sooo fantastic!!) all from scratch.

The space is inviting with clean simple and modern lines and appealing displays of their ingredients (fresh fruits and vegetables) in baskets, beautiful photos of local beaches and fruit and some motivational words on the walls. The staff is friendly, knowledgeable and on the ball. They serve up some fresh juices, smoothies amazing Acai bowls, salads snacks and some sweet treats like their decadent brownies!

I can't tell you which is my favourite because I love everything but that's probably because I totally love their food philosophy. I'm not vegan or a vegetarian and not on compete gluten free diet but I do agree with all those food philosophies I just can't claim them or adopt cause I am not one .....Yet at least!
<br>

One thing I am strong on is sugar filled drinks and snacks &mdash; don't get me started on that. I love how they sweeten with natural sugars from honey or agave nectar and you have the option of unsweetened also. You never find anything sweetened with any kind of refined sugar or additives or preservatives.  This is something you should be aware of if your expecting to have your carpe diem taste like a Starbucks/Rituals Frappacino. You're in the wrong place if you want high sugar drinks and snacks. If you want a place where you can get food and drinks that feed and nourish your body with the freshest  ingredients than this place will not disappoint!
