I love cheesecake - but then again so do most people. Creamy rich filing with a crisp crust - a perfect ratio of fat and sugar. However, I’m not too keen on the traditional toppings of cherries or blueberries though. I must admit that I usual scrape a lot of it to the side to get to the good stuff (sorry, I know).

But this little tweak proves to be a winner. Joanne had some passion fruit given to her by a friend and decided to give it a try. **It was a hit**. With just the right amount of fruit, it turned out to be a refreshing glaze. The citrus element made it feel deceptively lighter than it was.

Brought a slice to work and some of my coworkers went nuts. Literally had people asking for orders. We may consider it, but in the meantime I don’t mind being the beneficiary of Joanne’s culinary experiments.
