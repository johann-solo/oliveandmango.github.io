excerpt: <p>The ultimate summer side featuring smokey charred broccolini. It's both sweet and savoury with my favourite dressing of all time!</p>
---
I don't think the summer months or hot weather months are ever the same without grilled food.  Grilled veggies dressed in something nice is always a hit for any BBQ or picnic or family dinner.  That smokiness that grilling adds to the veggies is really like no other. This salad not only has the smokiness from the grilled broccolini, but also the crunch and sweetness of the red sweet peppers and grape tomatoes but also a nice savoury side thanks to the olives and feta. If you don't have a grill &mdash; no worries. That smokiness is easily achieved by roasting the broccolini. I have done both, and the result is delicious either way.

Grilled foods and salads really need a good dressing too. This balsamic dressing is my go to combination for literally any salad or grilled food. It's my favourite one to use and I make it all the time. It's the perfect  combo of tart and sweet and just adds so much flavour to anything you add it to.  If I don't have lemon juice, I will use apple cider vinegar instead. This makes enough for this salad plus a little extra that you can reserve to dress something else.  I usually make double so that I can use it through the week for other salads or veggies. It truly isn't worth buying dressing when you can make a fab one at home!

We gobbled this salad up so fast and I will definitely be making it again soon. I may try it will grilled asparagus when it's back in season as well. Hope you enjoy it and hope you definitely save this dressing recipe. You will not regret it!
