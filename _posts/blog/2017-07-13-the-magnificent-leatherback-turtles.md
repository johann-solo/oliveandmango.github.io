excerpt: <p>Get up close and personal with these threatened but beautiful species</p>
---
We are not alone. There are giant creatures from another realm that invade our world. That's how it may feel seeing the mammoth yet shy leatherback turtles emerging onto a beach in the dead of night. These gentle creatures are the largest of all living turtles. Their tear-dropped shaped body along with large flippers make them perfectly adapted for swimming in the open ocean. 

In spite of the leatherback's great size, they are definitely not at the top of the food chain or the predator chain. In fact, not only do the young have a precarious and grim life prospects (more on that later) but unfortunately the adults have been targets for poachers. As a result, the recorded numbers of nesting females has dropped to almost 20% in the last 30-40 years.

Trinidad and Tobago is one of the places where the female leatherback would come to lay and nest their eggs annually. The nesting season lasts from March to September.

One of the best places to see them in either the laying or the hatching stage, is in the North East section of Trinidad. During the peak season you are pretty much guaranteed to see several during the night.
