excerpt: <p>Get up close and personal with these threatened but beautiful species</p>
---
We are not alone. There are giant creatures from another realm that invade our world. That's how it may feel seeing the mammoth yet shy leatherback turtles emerging onto a beach in the dead of night. These gentle creatures are the largest of all living turtles, and seeing these amazing animals is not something to be missed &mdash; especially if you are a nature lover. 

Trinidad and Tobago is one of best places to catch sight of leatherback turtles as large numbers come to lay eggs every year on these shores. One of the best places to see them in either the laying or the hatching stage is in Grand Rivere in the North East part of Trinidad. Other areas such as Matura or Tobago are also viable options but there are advantages to making the journey to the Grand Rivere. There are usually more options for accommodation and Grand Rivere seems to attract a larger population of turtles which makes your chances of success at spotting them greater. During the peak season, you are pretty much guaranteed to see several during the night.

### When to go





Their tear-dropped shaped body along with large flippers make them perfectly adapted for swimming in the open ocean. 

In spite of the leatherback's great size, they are definitely not at the top of the food chain or the predator chain. In fact, not only do the young have a precarious and grim life prospects (more on that later) but unfortunately the adults have been targets for poachers. As a result, the recorded numbers of nesting females has dropped to almost 20% in the last 30-40 years.
