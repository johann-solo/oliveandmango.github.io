excerpt: <p>Get up close and personal with these threatened but beautiful species</p>

We are not alone. There are giant creatures from another realm that invade our world. That's how it may feel seeing the mammoth yet shy leatherback turtles emerging onto a beach in the dead of night. These gentle creatures are the largest of all living turtles, and seeing these amazing animals is not something to be missed &mdash; especially if you are a nature lover. 

> Grand Rivère is the second largest leatherback turtle nesting site in the world

Trinidad and Tobago is one of best places to catch sight of leatherback turtles as large numbers come to lay eggs every year on these shores. One of the best places to see them in either the laying or the hatching stage is in Grand Rivière in the North East part of Trinidad. Other areas such as Matura or Tobago are also viable options but there are advantages to making the journey to the Grand Rivière. There are usually more options for accommodation and Grand Rivière the second largest leatherback turtle nesting site in the world, which makes your chances of success at spotting them greater. During the peak season, you are pretty much guaranteed to see several during the night.

### When to go

The turtle season generally ranges from March to September. This will include the nesting as well as the hatching stages. The earlier months being best for seeing the laying process and the latter better for watching the young trying to make their way into the ocean. To get the best of both try going around June to get a glimpse of both.

### Where to stay

As mentioned, Grand Rivère is the where I would recommend you make your stay. The turtles only come after dark, so it is better to rent a hotel overnight to avoid the stress driving in the dark. The roads can be narrow and rough, plus it is a 3-hour​ trek from Port of Spain. Save yourself the hassle and check in for a night (you can also go with a tour bus if you want, but that means a round trip of at least 6 hours as they arrive and depart in the evening).

There are several options in Grand Rivère that range from the upper scale to rust, but when it comes to getting a great experience for seeing the leatherback turtles


Their tear-dropped shaped body along with large flippers make them perfectly adapted for swimming in the open ocean. 

In spite of the leatherback's great size, they are definitely not at the top of the food chain or the predator chain. In fact, not only do the young have a precarious and grim life prospects (more on that later) but unfortunately the adults have been targets for poachers. As a result, the recorded numbers of nesting females has dropped to almost 20% in the last 30-40 years.
