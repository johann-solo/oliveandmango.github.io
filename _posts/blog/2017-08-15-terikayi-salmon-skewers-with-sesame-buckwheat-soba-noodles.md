## For the salmon
Serves 4 
<br>

### Ingredients  
 
* 8 wooden skewers soaked in water for a 30 minutes before grilling 

* 4 boneless skinless salmon fillets sliced or cut in chunks (cut while still slightly frozen or place in the freezer for 10-15 min to freeze the fillets slightly which will make slicing easier) 

* &frac13; cup Tamari or soy sauce 

* &frac14; cup honey 

* 3 tbsp rice wine or rice vinegar 

* 1 tbsp of grated Ginger 

* 1 clove of garlic grated 

### Directions 

1. Heat the grill to medium and grease the grates with a little vegetable oil

1. In a small bowl whisk together the honey, tamari or soy sauce, rice vinegar, ginger and garlic and marinate the chunks or slices of salmon for approx 10 minutes (I reserve a couple of tbsp of the marinade in a separate bowl prior to marinating, to baste the fish while on the grill but that is optional)

1. Thread the salmon pieces onto the skewers and grill until done and edges start to have a nice char to them, turning them occasionally (takes 8-10 minutes or less depending on how large your pieces are).  You can alternatively keep the salmon as a filet and marinate as called for but pan fry the fillets in a skillet if you don't have a grill or grill pan.  

1. Remove from grill when done and serve immediately with the noodles 


## For the sesame soba noodles 

* 1 package of buckwheat soba noodles 12.8oz cooked according to package directions and then set aside 

* 3 tbsp of olive oil 

* 3 cloves garlic minced 

* 1 tbsp chopped Ginger 

* 1&frac12; cups of carrots cut into thin matchsticks 

* 1&frac12; cups of sweet peppers (I used red and yellow pimentos but you can use any kind) sliced finely 

* 1 cup of snow peas trimmed and washed 

* 1 onion sliced finely 

* 3 Tsp​ sesame oil 

* 1/4 cup honey 

* &frac14; cup tamari or soy sauce 

* 2 tbsp rice vinegar 

* 1 small bunch of chives or scallions very thinly chopped 

* 2 tbsp sesame seeds 

* 1 cup of bean sprouts 

### Directions 

1. In a small bowl combine and whisk together the sesame oil, honey, tamari or soy sauce, and rice vinegar and set aside 

1. In a large sized skillet or wok heat the olive oil to medium heat and stir fry the onion, garlic, Ginger, carrots, peppers and snow peas for approx 4 minutes 

1. Add the soba noodles and toss while adding in the sauce a tbsp at a time until everything is well coated. Taste and adjust the ​amount of tamari or soy sauce and sesame oil to your liking. 

1. Plate and top with sliced scallions and sesame seeds, top with 2 salmon skewers and a handful of sprouts
