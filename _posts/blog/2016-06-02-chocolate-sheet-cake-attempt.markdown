A guaranteed crowd pleaser for almost everyone - unless they are gluten and nut intolerant or those rare ones who hate chocolate!?!?!?

This is a fantastic recipe from the Pioneer Woman which is definitely a keeper and will be my go to dessert recipe to feed a crowd.  Why a crowd? It's a sheet cake of course that's why. But this recipe not only packs quantity but delivers on quality as well.

One of the best things about this recipe is that it's not only easy but I can get all the ingredients from one grocery store! Yay!! Basically a miracle here in Trinidad.   There is one ingredient that usually is a little  iffy.  That darned exotic buttermilk!!  

They actually had it at the grocery store this time. I was so excited to see it on the shelf I almost bought them all. There's always another option if you can't get your hands on some. This is an easy way to just make some in minutes. [Homemade buttermilk](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/emeril-lagasse/homemade-buttermilk-recipe.html)

This really comes in handy especially when I want to whip up some buttermilk pancakes on the fly providing you have milk and lemon juice or vinegar.

Did I say that this recipe is super easy?  Can't appreciate this enough.  Quick and easy to make the batter, 20 minutes in the oven, make the frosting while the cake is in the oven and poor it over right out of the oven.  Can't get easier than that unless you want prepackaged cake mixes. Which I don't judge if you like that sort of thing but that's not usually my thing. So it's nice to find a recipe that is basic, simple, delicious and from scratch.  


> It's rich without being too decadent, light, kind of fudgey, kind of reminiscent of a pudding cause of the slight stickiness of it and completely irresistible!!


Speaking of delicious. Let me tell you a little about the taste of this cake.  Cross between a cake and a brownie was what many said about it when it was served.  It's rich without being too decadent, light, kind of fudgey, kind of reminiscent of a pudding cause of the slight stickiness of it and completely irresistible!!  

Hope you enjoy and definitely take a fork to it as soon as your finished icing it!!
