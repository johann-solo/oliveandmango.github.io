This is one of my favorite salads.  Don't get me wrong I absolutely love all Greek salads but this one just tops the list for me.  It blends some of my favorite herbs( dill and parsley) and my favorite dressing which is simply made up of lemon, olive oil salt and pepper to taste. Some add oregano too but that is optional. Now here in Trinidad, seasonally, we don't always have lemons available so instead I use vinegar. Your basic white or red wine vinegar.

## Ingredients

* Romaine lettuce finely chopped (almost like your slicing it)
* A few sprigs of green onion chopped finely
* A small bunch of dill chopped finely
* A small bunch of parsley chopped finely
* Dressing made of lemon juice,and olive oil, salt and pepper to taste and oregano is optional as I said before.

Combine all fresh green ingredients, top with dressing and toss.  
I add a little crumbled feta and basically I can eat this all day!!!!!
