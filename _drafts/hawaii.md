Hawaii is one of those places that has more to do that you realise at first. Unless you’re spending a long time there (which would be great!) you almost have to choose what aspects of it you really want to see. We felt like it was one of those places that you just didn’t get a chance to see




## Excursions
Manoa falls in an afternoon
Short, nice trail. Beautyful wildflowers. Not too difficult but can be slippery when wet (which can be often in Oahu)

### Koko crater trail
Koko crater trail is not to far from Hanuama bay and the view from the top is just awesome In every direction. The day we went up had a lot of clouds in the sky but they say that of clear day you can see all the islands. The hike isn't for the weary and not so great if you have bad knees. Right from the start of the trail you will ask yourself "why am I doing this?" And you will continue to ask yourself that as you go up.  It's literally like doing 'climbing' lunges.  So definitely be prepared to sweat, bring lots of water and and your camera. I'm a sucker for punishment so I totally loved it and the feeling when you reach the top is exhilarating.

## Food

### Eat a Hulu pie at Duke’s
Simply put - you can't leave Oahu without going to Duke's. It's touristy and cliche, but it's so accessible and has one of the best desserts on the island. The place is filled with memorbilia of the charming Duke Kahanamoku and digging into his history is well worth the time. But *do not* leave without getting a Hulu pie. I still have dreams about this amazing ice cream cake topped with Hawaii's famous macadamia nuts. 

### Be cool like the locals and have some shave ice
Like most warm cultures cold treats are a favourite in Hawaii. Shave ice is a simple and sweet treat. It can be found almost everywhere and you can top it was a kaledescope of colours (I mean flavours). You can go from very simple to very extravegant. Two popluar places to pick them up are in the North coast - Aoki's and Matsumoto Shave Ice. If you don't want to be taken for a tourist call it *shave* ice not shaved ice.

## Regrets - I've had a few

Hawaii is awesome. And while we did enjoy our trip, there were things we just couldn't get to. I would have loved to visit a macadamia nut plantation.
