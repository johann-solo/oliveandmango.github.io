Hawai'i is one of those places that has more things to do and see than you first realise. Unless you’re spending a long time there (which would be great!) you almost have to choose what aspects of it you really want to see. We felt like it was one of those places that would require multiple visits to really take it in.
<br>
<br>

We stayed just a couple blocks away from the main strip of Waikiki beach in a hotel with a kitchenette which was perfect for storing our snacks and drinks.  We even cooked dinner twice.  It's good to always have the option.  But that being said there are so many good eats in Hawai'i so plan to indulge.  Another tip is definitely rent a car.  You will want to get around and explore all of O'ahu and this is the most practical way to do it.  Try to use your points or coupons to rent or whatever it takes if your conscience of your budget.  It's worth even if you have to cook a few meals while your there.  One of the highlights of the trip was freely exploring the whole coast. We stoped and took in the sites and enjoyed almost all the accessible beaches on the island.  We would not do it differently.  And you shouldn't either especially if you have only a short stay.

Using O'ahu as a "home base" is great because it itself has plenty to do and it's also fairly central with easy access to the other islands. Since we didn't have too much time we decided to focus our attention mainly on O'ahu with a few jaunts to the other islands. Here are a few things we enjoyed broken down into a few categories.
<br>
<br>

## The great outdoors
When it comes to walking trails and hikes On O'ahu there is no shortage.  They are pretty accessible too. There is a lot of info on each individual hike. It's good to do a little research before hand while you're planning your trip to consider length and intensity of hikes so that you can plan your day and also know what your getting into.
Here are a few that we did
<br>
<br>

### Manoa falls in an afternoon
Short, nice trail. Beautiful wildflowers. Not too difficult but can be slippery when wet (which can be often in O'ahu)
<br>
<br>

### Koko crater trail
Koko crater trail is not to far from Hanuama bay and the view from the top is just awesome in every direction. The day we went up had a lot of clouds in the sky but they say that of clear day you can see all the islands. The hike isn't for the weary and not so great if you have bad knees. Right from the start of the trail you will ask yourself "why am I doing this?" And you will continue to ask yourself that as you go up.  It's literally like doing 'climbing' lunges.  So definitely be prepared to sweat, bring lots of water and and your camera. I'm a sucker for punishment so I totally loved it and the feeling when you reach the top is exhilarating.

### Nu'uanu Pali lookout
Nu'uanu Pali lookout is a gorgeous spot to enjoy scenic views and take some amazing pictures of the windward coast of O'ahu. It's pretty winding so bring a light jacket. The unique mountain ranges (which are breathtaking) as well as other landmarks can be seen in their full glory.  You can get different views by taking a trail at the lower end of the lookout that follows along the Old Pali highway trail of you have a little extra time to explore.

## Excursions
<br>

### Dole plantation
Dole plantation is worth a visit. It's the complete pineapple experience from seeing where and how they grow to indulging is some pineapple treats like their creamy and deliciously refreshing pineapple ice cream. The shop has lots of treats and memorabilia if you wanted to take a little piece of Dole home with you.

### Hanauma Bay Nature Preserve
Once a volcanic crater turned - beautiful curved cove and home 400 plus species of fish and also spot some turtles making it and important nature preserve and the most popular snorkelling spot on the island.  Preservation is so important and before entering you must watch a video about how to show care and respect for the reef and reed life. Then your free to enjoy the clear blue water and In fact the day we were there a couple of seal's were chilling on the beach next to us.

## Food
The food scene in the Hawai'i chain is great. It's mainly a fusion of the local pacific traditions, Asian cultures like Japanese, Korean, Chinese with a classic American backdrop. There's so much variety in good food in O'ahu.  Spam isn't  the only thing they serve up! In fact we had fabulous fresh sushi, awesome Mexican food and great food truck experiences (food trucks are so popular you can find almost any kind of food and drink served up in a food truck. Down load an app so you know where to find one with what you want). A vibrant food truck culture exists especially on the north coast. Definitely worth checking out if you are a food lover. Oh and **Do not** miss [Opal Thai Food](http://opalthai.com) (see below)
<br>

### Eat a Hulu pie at Duke’s
Simply put &mdash; you can't leave O'ahu without going to Duke's. It's touristy and cliche, but it's so accessible and has one of the best desserts on the island. The place is filled with memorabilia of the charming Duke Kahanamoku and digging into his history is well worth the time. But *do not* leave without getting a Hulu pie. I still have dreams about this amazing ice cream cake topped with Hawai'i's famous macadamia nuts.
<br>

### Be cool like the locals and have some shave ice
Like most warm cultures cold treats are a favourite in Hawai'i. Shave ice is a simple and sweet treat. It can be found almost everywhere and you can top it was a kaleidoscope of colours (I mean flavours). You can go from very simple to very extravagant. Two popular places to pick them up are in the North coast - Aoki's and Matsumoto Shave Ice. If you don't want to be taken for a tourist call it *shave* ice not shaved ice.
<br>

### Loco Moco - Spam and rice, yum?
A popular cheap way that is also filling and served almost everywhere is Loco moco.  This is a meal in the contemporary Hawai'ian cuisine. It's layered rice, meat of your choice, topped with fried egg, and a variety of sauce options. They have vegetarian options too.  You can even get your spam fix if you wanted to.

### Malasadas - Deep-fried dough done right
Malasadas are a Portuguese confection brought to Hawai'i from immigrants of the Madeira islands. They gained popularity as a favourite during Mardi Gras in the lead up to Lent by those early visitors. Traditional malasadas are deep-fried and rolled with granulated sugar. But like many other things on the islands, Hawai'ians have made them their own by filling them with cream, custard, chocolate or guava - just to name a few.
<br>

### Opal Thai Food - Food genious at work
I saved the best for last. This places is literally a reason in itself to make the trek to Hawai'i not matter where in the world you live. Yes, it's that good. Having a start as a food truck on the North coast, it's popularity eventually made this a full-fledged restaurant. Relaxed, down to earth and unassuming the place perfectly reflects it's chef and owner. He is famous for remembering people and what they had and often comes out of the kitchen to sit and personally take your order. Even though there was a menu, he kind of 'interviewed' us instead asking what we like, what we had etc. and then said 'he had something in mind". We didn't know what he was going to bring but when it did, it was amazing. Customised food to your palate. Never boring, never the same. Just trust the man, he tries to out do himself every time. If you are a foodie **do not miss**.
<br>

## Regrets - I've had a few

Hawai'i is awesome. And while we did enjoy our trip, there were things we just couldn't get to. I would have loved to visit a macadamia nut plantation.

## Conclusion
Yes Hawai'i  is definitely a great place to chill and enjoy the beach and some relaxation but do take the time out for hikes and walks and to enjoy some of the most breathtaking views and experiences!! You won't regret it.
