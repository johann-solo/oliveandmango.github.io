I made my first Dutch baby during a Rainydaybites cookbook challenge and so glad I was in on that month’s challenge. I always wanted to make one but just never got around to it and for some reason I thought that making them would be overly complex. The opposite was true. But before I get into the important features of making a Dutch baby let me tell those of you who don’t know what it is a little more about it.

A Dutch Baby is pretty much a giant pancake. The texture is a bit different then a pancake though. The dutch baby is fluffy like a popover with crisp edges and kind of has a light and airy custardy centre. It’s normally served with a dusting of sugar and a splash of lemon juice. I love it with fresh fruit and maple syrup. I also love savoury ones too. The first one I made was a savoury one and I think I should definitely share that recipe with you guys soon.

You all know by now that chocolate is basically my middle name if I had one, so I needed to make a chocolate one. It took a few tries to get some of the ingredients just right to make a nice and fluffy one.  I was very happy with this one and I totally love the texture of it too. I served it up with homemade strawberry sauce, cause chocolate and strawberries is a classic combo that never fails to be adored and of course more chocolate in the form of homemade sauce. I also dusted it with powdered sugar for dramatic affect and you just can’t have a sweet one without it.

At the outset I mentioned there are a couple MUST do’s when making a Dutch baby no matter which kind you’re making and here they are. Firstly, I like to use a food processor or blender when making mine because you achieve the smoothest batter this way. Let the machine do the work. Secondly, I learned from experimentation that you need to let the batter sit for a while before pouring it into the pan which allows the flour to absorb all the liquid.

Using a 9-10 inch skillet is best.  Any larger and you won’t get as much puff or rise out of your Dutch baby. A very hot oven and a very hot pan is also essential.  That is why you need to make sure your oven is preheated and make sure your pan is in the oven while it’s preheating. This makes making the Dutch baby a little dangerous in a sense because you’re working with a hot pan and trying to move quickly. So stay calm and keep your wits about you when making it and make sure to use you oven mitts. Some unintentional rhyming going on there. That’s pretty much it! You’ll get yourself a lovely delicious Dutch baby every time.

What a high maintenance pancake right? Totally worth the effort. It’s a thing of beauty coming out of the oven and there will be lots of oohs and awwws when you bring it to the brunch or breakfast table. I serve it right out of the pan (carefully).

It might be a little fussy to make but it’s also worth it because its totally delicious too. It deflates in like 60 seconds (which is great when you want to photograph it by the way - NOT) but even after deflating is still fabulous  and a great alternative to the homelier pancake.  Even without the puff factor it’s delicious and worth a try! A total show stopper!

### Ingredients

**For the Dutch Baby**

* &frac34; cup whole milk 
* 3 large eggs 
* &frac13; cup of all purpose flour 
* &frac14; cup unsweetened cocoa powder 
* 1 tsp baking powder 
* Pinch of salt 
* &frac12; tsp of pure vanilla extract 
* &frac14; cup of granulated sugar 
* 2 tbsp of butter 
* Powdered sugar for serving 

**For the strawberry sauce**

* 1 (16 oz) package or approx 2 cups of frozen strawberries. Can use fresh hulled ones too
* 1-2 tbsp of maple syrup depending on how sweet you want it 

**For the chocolate sauce**

* 150 grams of dark chocolate or semisweet 
* 50 ml of cream or whole milk 
* 30 ml of brewed coffee (optional) 

### Directions

1. Combine frozen strawberries and maple syrup in medium sauce pan. Bring the mixture to a boil and then reduce heat to medium-low and simmer for 10-15 minutes until the sauce reaches a syrupy consistency. As the sauce simmers, break apart the whole berries with a wooden spoon or fork.  Set aside once done. 
2. In a separate small sauce pan place the chocolate, cream and coffee on low heat and allow chocolate to melt, stirring frequently until chocolate is melted and mixture is smooth and creamy. Once done set aside 
3. Combine milk, eggs, flour, cocoa powder, salt, vanilla, and sugar in a blender and blend for approx 1 minute until smooth. Leave the batter in the blender and set aside to rest 20 to 25 minutes. This gives the flour time to absorb the liquid.
4. Meanwhile, place the oven-safe skillet you're using on a middle rack to warm along with the oven. Heat the oven to 425°F. 
5. When ready to make the pancake, remove the skillet from the oven using oven mitts and place it on top of the stove. Add the butter and swirl the pan to melt the butter and coat the bottom and sides of the pan.
6. Pour the batter on top of the butter. Tilt the pan if needed so that the batter runs evenly to all sides. Place the skillet in the oven.
7. Bake until the Dutch baby is puffed, lightly browned across the top, and darker brown on the sides and edges, 15 to 20 minutes.
8. Serve immediately. You can either serve from the pan or transfer the Dutch baby to a serving platter. Dust with powdered sugar. Cut into wedges and serve with strawberry sauce and a good drizzle of chocolate sauce.
