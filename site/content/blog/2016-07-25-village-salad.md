excerpt: This salad is a classic and is great if you prefer less lettuce and more chunking vegetables in your salad

Many recipes call for a vinaigrette made of olive oil and red wine vinegar which is totally delicious. But I personally don't add the vinegar. I find the tomatoes although firm get a little macerated and the acidity from them is a good enough combo with the olive oil.

I didn't put measurements because it's up to you how much tomatoes and cucumber and sweet pepper you would like to add for the size of the salad your making. Season to taste as well and omit the olives and cheese according to your diet and taste.
</br>
</br>

Enjoy with crusty bread for dipping the delicious juices created by the tomato and the rich olive oil and crumbled feta.
