It’s that time of year when pumpkin and fall squash have their day or more like their month in the spotlight. The most classic way to enjoy them this time of year is none other than a pumpkin pie. It’s a harvest food classic. I have wanted to recreate Four & Twenty Blackbirds recipe for their brown butter pumpkin pie since last year but I wanted to do a maple twist to it. I love the flavour of the maple syrup and also think that it suits pumpkin so well. My family really loved this pie. The flavours in it are wonderful. It requires just one extra step for the filling which includes browning the butter and then caramelizing it with the sugar and cream. It's so worth the extra few minutes it takes to prep this part of the pie.

You will save time making this pie using a store bought pie filling though. The one I look for is always E.D. Smith’s Pure Pumpkin. I have been using their pumpkin for as long as I can remember. It’s made with 100% Pure Dickinson Pumpkin. It has no preservatives, sugars or flavours added making it a staple item in my pantry. I love making things from scratch when I have time but this is what I always grab for most if not all my baked goods including pumpkin pie. The consistency and texture of good quality canned pumpkin like this one is far superior to homemade, not to mention the shortcut on labor.

This pie is definitely where I will gladly open a can to make a pie filling. Makes things easier and is a huge time saver. Feel free to use good store bought pie crusts for this recipe as well if that makes it even easier for you. I have included the homemade recipe I use but if you are in a pinch for time a good quality store bought crust will also do the trick.

E.D. Smith products have been in my life since I can remember. Not only do I use their fillings in my pies but also over my cheesecakes. E.D. Smith pie fillings are #1 in Canada and  have been inspiring Canadian Bakers for over 135 years. I grew up in Hamilton and Stoney Creek Ontario and had the E.D. Smith factory in Winona close by - passing by it almost everyday. It’s a brand I have always known and loved and was so happy that I could even get it in Trinidad while I lived there. It felt like a taste of home when I would use it while I was there and it still does. Hope you guys love this pie - it’s the new favorite pumpkin pie in our house. I like it with a sprinkle of flaky sea salt and loads of whip cream. Enjoy!

## Recipe

### Ingredients

* <span itemprop="ingredients">Two 9-inch pie doughs (1 if not making the leaf cutouts) - storebought or homemade recipe below </span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">6 tbsp unsalted butter</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">&frac34; cup dark brown sugar</span> 
* <span itemprop="ingredients">2 tbsp water </span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">&frac12; cup heavy cream </span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">1 tsp vanilla extract </span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">2 large eggs </span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">2 large egg yolks </span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">&frac12; tsp salt </span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">1 &frac23; cups <span class="highlight"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.edsmith.com/en/products/pure-pumpkin/">E.D. Smith Pure Pumpkin</a></span></span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">1 tbsp pumpkin pie spice </span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">1 tsp molasses </span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice </span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">&frac12; cup whole milk </span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">&frac14; cup maple syrup </span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">&frac13; cup carrot juice</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">Flaky sea salt for sprinkling over pie as a garnish (optional)</span>

### Directions

__Fit the crust into pan__

1. Gently fit the first rolled out pie dough into the bottom and up the sides of a pie dish with a flat rimmed edge. 
2. Trim the dough to within a ½ inch of the pie dish rim and refrigerate while you make the filling and while you prepare the other dough for the cutouts if using. 

__Make the brown butter caramel__

1. In a small sauce pan melt the butter over medium-low heat. Continue to cook; the butter will foam and then begin to turn golden, then a nutty brown; whisk occasionally. When the butter is fragrant and nutty and has browned, add the brown sugar, whisk, and then carefully add the water while whisking. Bring the mixture to a boil and continue to simmer for a few minutes until the mixture smells caramelized and starts to darken in colour. Slowly drizzle in the heavy cream (the mixture will bubble rapidly) and whisk until smooth. Remove from heat and allow to cool for a few minutes before whisking in the vanilla extract. Set aside 

2. Preheat oven to 425°F. 

__Prepare the Pumpkin pie filling__

1. In a separate small bowl, lightly whisk the eggs and yolks together with the salt and set aside. In the bowl of a food processor or blender blend the pumpkin puree with the pumpkin pie spice and lemon juice until smooth. With the machine running on low, stream the brown-butter caramel through the food processor’s top opening and process until combined. Drizzle in the egg mixture, followed by the milk, maple syrup and carrot juice; blend until smooth, stopping once or twice to scrape down the sides. 

2. Remove pie crust from fridge and place on baking sheet. Pour filling into it and bake on the middle rack of the oven for 15 minutes.  Reduce the heat to 350°F and bake for another 35-40 minutes, or when the center jiggles only slightly when shaken. Allow to cool completely on a wire rack, 2 to 3 hours. (Proceed with baking the remaining cutouts if using) Serve slightly warm, at room temperature, or cool with whip cream.

## Homemade Flaky Pie Crust (makes two 9 inch pie crusts)

* <span itemprop="ingredients">2½ cups all-purpose Flour</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">3 tbsp sugar</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">¼ tsp salt</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">¼ cup shortening</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">12 tbsp (1½ sticks) butter, cold and cut into small cubes</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">¼ cup ice water </span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">1-2 eggs beaten fo egg wash </span>

### Directions

1. Place the flour, sugar, and salt in the bowl of a food processor and pulse the mixture a few times until well combined.
2. Add the shortening to the food processor and pulse once. Add the cubes of butter, one at a time, pulsing 1 to 2 times after the addition of each cube.
3. With the processor running on low, drizzle in the ice water until the mixture starts to form into large clumps.
4. Divide the dough in half. Form each into a disc and wrap one half in plastic wrap and refrigerate. Place the other disc in between two sheets of parchment paper. Roll to a circle that is 1½-2 inches larger in circumference than your pie dish. Place the sheet of dough over the top of your pie dish and remove parchment paper. Gently press the dough in to fit the bottom and sides of a pie dish with. Trim the dough to within a ½ inch of the pie dish rim and refrigerate (at this point you can make the filling, fill the cooled crust and bake as is without the cut outs) 
5. Roll out the other disc int a circle the same as the first and cut leaf shapes out of the dough and place on a parchment lined baking sheet. 
6. Remove pie dish from fridge and brush the flat edges of the pie crust with egg wash and then line the rim with half of the leaves decoratively. Refrigerate again. Brush the remaining leaves with egg wash and refrigerate them on the sheet pan while the pie bakes. After pie is out of the oven bake the remaining leaves at 350°F for 10-15 minutes or until they are golden brown. Remove from oven and let cool. Use these to decorate the inner ring of the pie or over it to your liking.
