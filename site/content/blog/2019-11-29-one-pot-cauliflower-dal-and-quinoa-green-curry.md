It never fails, at least once a week there is some sort of curry on the dinner table. I crave it at least once a week and many variations of it. This week comes this one pot meal that is simple to make, light yet super nourishing.

It’s loaded with veggies and greens apart from the green curry itself and lots of protein from the lentils, chickpeas and of-course the quinoa.  I love a little heat in my curry but if you don’t you can definitely control it by reducing the amount of chilies in it. It’s also quite creamy from the coconut milk. If you prefer it a little lighter you can substitute some of it with broth.

There are a great amount of fabulous recipes out there for homemade green curry paste or sauce. Homemade curry paste is always the best. It does make all the difference in a curry dish but let’s be real we don’t always have time to make it homemade and that is ok, thank goodness to the very many decent ready made store bought ones out there that save the day. This recipe works well with both so feel free to use homemade or store bought.

The addition of quinoa into the pot turns this curry into a full meal, one that is filling and so delicious. I made this one in using GoGoQuinoa's <span class="highlight"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.gogoquinoa.com/products/white-quinoa/">White Quinoa</a></span>. Quinoa makes for the perfect plant based protein addition. I love it in stews and soups and as a fluffy side. It cooks perfectly in this curry and it some excellent texture as well. This is definitely my go to kind of comfort meal for the midweek. Quick and easy and never disappoints - hope you enjoy it!

### Directions

1. Heat a dutch oven or pot over medium heat. Once hot, add oil, onion, ginger, green chilies if using, and garlic. Sauté for 2-3 minutes, stirring frequently. Then add curry paste and cook for 1-2 minutes more.
2. Add cauliflower, quinoa and red lentils and sauté for a few more minutes. Add coconut milk, and broth and stir to combine. Bring to a simmer. Then stir in the fish sauce or tamari. 
3. Return to a simmer and cook for approximately 15-20 minutes or until the lentils, and cauliflower are tender and quinoa is cooked through. In the last 5 minutes of cooking, add spinach and chickpeas and stir until wilted (about 3 minutes).
4. Stir in the cilantro and lime juice. Taste and adjust flavour as needed, adding salt and pepper, or green curry paste for more intense curry flavor. 
5. Serve garnished with more cilantro, lime slices and sliced chili’s (red or green). I also love drizzling my bowl with chili oil for a little extra heat.
