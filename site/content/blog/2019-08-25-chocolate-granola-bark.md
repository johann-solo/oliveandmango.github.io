I made this bark in partnership with Bob’s Red Mill and their new series of Pan-Baked granolas. They come in 4 delicious flavours: Lemon Blueberry, Cranberry Almond, Coconut Spice, and Maple Sea Salt. When I saw their Maple Sea Salt flavour I knew it would be my favorite. I love them all like a parent loves all their children but we all know that although there is some truth in that there’s always one that stands out more than the others (for our family that was always my brother- don’t deny it Greg) - and to me that is this Maple Sea Salt granola. I love all four flavours but I feel this one ‘stands’ out the most to me. I knew exactly what I was going to do with it as soon as I saw this flavour. Other than snack on it 24/7 that is (as I’m doing right now as I write this - you know for inspirational purposes).

You already know I love maple syrup. Can you believe there are people out there that do not like maple syrup? They really do exist. Well this perfectly crispy, toasted, golden brown granola not only is sweetened with real maple syrup, but also loaded with all the rest of the things I love. It is made with whole grain oats and coconut oil and has, coconut chips in it along with pumpkin seeds, sesame seeds and sunflower seeds. The end result? Crunchy delicious clusters that are rich in flavour (but not too sweet) and taste just like they came out of your own oven. The slight salty finish in each bite is just the cherry on top!

With all those crunchy bits and extra seeds and coconut chips I knew that I wanted to make a chocolate bark with this granola. Other than chocolate itself and some flaky sea salt, that is basically all you need to make this delicious bark. No need to add more nuts seeds or anything. The only thing I did add is just a touch of cocoa butter. Adding the cocoa butter helps with to pre-crystallize the chocolate with helps the tempering process and makes it easier to work with and spread and will help give your chocolate bark a nice snap. I learned that from _Cupcake Jemma_. It’s not essential in making bark but helps with the texture. Feel free to leave it out if you don’t have any.

Good chocolate is a must when making bark because it’s the chocolate itself that is the base of the whole recipe. Choose one that you love and it will make a superior bark. This bark makes for a great gift it makes it out of the house. It also makes for a healthier treat as well cause I think every balanced diet need a good dose of dark chocolate or what’s the point of living?!? Ok that’s pretty dramatic but you know what I mean. You will love this bark - we plan to have a constant supply of it in the freezer!

## Recipe
Serves 8
</br>
</br>

### Ingredients

* <span itemprop="ingredients">8oz dark chocolate, chopped </span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">1 oz of cocoa butter (optional but recommended) </span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">1 cup of <span class="highlight"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.bobsredmill.com/maple-sea-salt-pan-baked-granola.html">Bob’s Red Mill Pan-Baked Maple Sea Salt Granola</a></span> </span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">&frac12; tsp flaky sea salt </span>

### Directions

1. Prepare a baking sheet by lining it with parchment paper and set aside. 
2. Melt &frca23; of the chopped chocolate and the cocoa butter if using in a double boiler or in the microwave at 20 second intervals, until chocolate is melted and smooth.  
3. Take off the double boiler and heat and stir in the remaining 1/3 of the chopped chocolate. Continue to stir gently until the rest of the chocolate is melted. 
4. Pour the melted chocolate onto the parchment lined baking sheet and spread it out evenly to fill the rectangular shaped pan. 
5. Immediately scatter the granola over the chocolate and sprinkle with flaky salt. Refrigerate until set about 20 minutes and then break into pieces to serve. Can be stored in a sealed container refrigerated for up to a week - but it definitely won’t last that long.
