This breakfast casserole is a life saver especially on those busy mornings when all you have time to do for breakfast is grab something on your way out the door. It makes for the perfect breakfast meal-prep. I love to make it Sunday mornings. It’s delicious and comforting right out of the oven and I end up reheating it Monday and Tuesday (if it lasts that long) for breakfast and it’s perfect.

I made this recipe in partnership with Bob’s Red Mill to showcase their brand new line of Pan-Baked Granolas. They come in 4 different flavours and are fabulous. Although 4 granolas are delicious on their own for breakfast or as a snack, I thought I would get creative and use them in unique and delicious ways. For this recipe I used <span class="highlight"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.bobsredmill.com/cranberry-almond-pan-baked-granola.html">Bob’s Red Mill Pan-Baked Cranberry Almond Granola</a></span> as a crunchy crumble topping.

It’s beautifully spiced and loaded with almonds! pumpkin seeds, dried cranberries and coconut. It made the perfect crumble and complimented this apple cranberry baked oatmeal really well. Their granolas are just like homemade granola. They are USDA Certified Organic, Kosher, and Non-GMO Project Certified, also made with Bob’s Red Mill Whole Grain Oats and GFCO Certified (Gluten Free).

Baked oatmeal makes eating oatmeal feel a little like a special treat. Its definitely not your ordinary boring oatmeal but a special oatmeal based bake up with fruit and nuts. It’s an easy to make breakfast and a delicious way to start the morning in a healthy and satisfying way. It’s also naturally sweetened with maple syrup and a very adaptable recipe when it comes to spicing it up and your add ins. Each season bings new fruits to experiment with in this baked oatmeal.

Throughout the summer I was using fresh berries in this same recipe. I used pecans instead of almonds. Not only can you change the fruit according to the season, but you can also either use fresh or frozen fruit. It’s a great staple recipe to have on hand to help with the weeks breakfast. As fall is ever near with all the commercial signs of it approaching, I decided to go with a classic combo of apples and cranberries. There are absolutely no fresh cranberries in sight right now but there are always frozen ones available and so I used frozen. Go ahead and bake some now for the rest of the week.  It’s a life saver for back to school and if your trying to reset and get back into a routine it makes the perfect quick, healthy breakfast or snack throughout the week and everyone is happy!

* <span itemprop="ingredients">2 teaspoons vanilla extract</span>

### Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 375°F and frease a 9-inch square baking dish or skillet. 
2. In a medium mixing bowl, combine the oats, toasted nuts, spices, baking powder, and salt. 
3. In another small bowl whisk the milk, maple syrup, egg, the butter and vanilla.
4. Reserve a few slices of apple and a few cranberries for topping the baked oatmeal, then arrange the remaining apples and cranberries evenly over the bottom of the baking dish or skillet. 
5. Cover the fruit with the dry oat mixture, then drizzle the wet ingredients over the oats. Gently wriggle the skillet to make sure the milk works it way down through the oats and the fruit and then gently pat down any dry oats resting on top.
6. Scatter the remaining cranberries and apples over top along with the Bob’s Red Mill Pan-Baked Cranberry Almond Granola
7. Bake for 40-45 minutes, until the top is nice and golden and oatmeal is just set. Remove from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes then slice and serve with extra fruit. 
8. The oatmeal keeps well in the refrigerator, covered, for 4 to 5 days. You can reheat individual portions in the microwave before serving.
