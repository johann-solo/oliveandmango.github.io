description: Make your own homemade oat milk. It's naturally creamy, sweet and the perfect dairy, nut, soy milk alternative
---

We have been enjoying oat milk here and there anytime we are out grabbing a coffee when it’s offered as a milk alternative. It’s got a natural sweetness and creaminess to it that both me and hubby love. I looked into making our own as we enjoy it so much and found out that it’s really the simplest thing to make.

### Why oat milk? 
Oat milk is a great diary alternative and is also great for those looking for a dairy free alternative that is also nut and soy free. It has a naturally creamier texture than nut milk without all the extra additives as more of the ‘food’ itself passes through the cheesecloth when straining it. It’s a great low cost alternative to nut milk. Also if you are one to think about sustainable eating or drinking in this case, you may want to ditch almond milk or at least swap it out occasionally for an alternative milk ie. Oat milk, lessening the load on the environmental damage almond plantations are doing in countries where almonds are grown (California being the one where almost all of them are grown). So as you can see there are plenty of reasons to try oat milk.

### Why make rather than buy?
The obvious reason for that is when you are making your oat milk you know exactly what you are putting into it. Many commercial varieties pump it full of additives, preservatives, and sugars. So naturally making it at home is a great option and it’s so easy to make that it really makes sense to make it at home. My oats of choice for making oat milk are <span class="highlight"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.bobsredmill.com/organic-regular-rolled-oats.html">Bob’s Red Mill Organic Old Fashioned Oats</a></span>. Bob’s Red Mill offers the largest lines of organic, whole grain foods in the country. All of their products are certified Kosher and made with ingredients grown from non-GMO seeds and that’s why I love using their oats in this oat milk as well as in my overnight  oats - warm cooked oats or any other oat needs I may have.

### Oat milk FYI
Although oats are naturally gluten-free, they are often processed in facilities that also process other gluten- containing grains resulting in cross contamination. If you have celiac disease, a gluten intolerance or sensitivity, be sure to use certified gluten free oats to make your oat milk. In terms of nutrition when I was doing my research I learned that - yes oat milk is higher in calories and carbs than nut milk,  but it’s ok because it provides energy through these carbs and fiber as opposed to fats which can typically be the case with most nut milks. Many people soak their oats before making it or use steel cut oats instead but I have kept things super simple by using olds fashion oats and no soaking.  I find that the longer the oats sit in the water, the gummy’er or slimier the oats get so I personally do not soak the oats. Feel free to experiment and see what suits you. Below is my favorite way of making it.

### What can I use it in?
We love it in our coffee and as you can see we love making matcha lattes with it. You can have it in your smoothie and cereal or even with your oats (oats on oats). I have never used it in baked goods but apparently it’s a great milk substitute for waffles, pancakes and other baked goods. You can flavour and sweeten your oat milk with honey, maple syrup and many even blend in dates with the oats to sweeten it.  We love using maple syrup because we love the flavour of it but it’s really up to you to choose what sweetener you would like to add and how much if it. That goes the same for the flavour addition. Adding the vanilla extract is totally optional.

We are total converts, in fact my husband prefers the flavour of oat milk over almond milk.  It’s such a simple thing to make and easy enough to incorporate into your weekly routine. Plus the leftover ground oats can easily be added to your overnight oats killing two birds with one stone when it comes to your brekkie meal prep. You’re welcome and enjoy!

## Recipe
### Ingredients 

* <span itemprop="ingredients"> 1 cup <span class="highlight"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.bobsredmill.com/organic-regular-rolled-oats.html">Bob’s Red Mill Organic Old Fashioned Oats</a></span></span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients"> 4 cups water (use a little less water for a creamier milk)</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients"> 1 pinch salt</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients"> 2 tbsp maple syrup (optional)</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients"> 1 tsp vanilla extract (optional)</span>

### Directions

1. Add oats, water, salt, and any additional sweetener and flavouring ingredients to a high-speed blender. 
2. Blend for about 1 minute or until the mixture seems well combined. Over-blending can make the oat milk slimy in texture so be careful of over blending. 
3. Pour the mixture over a large mixing bowl or pitcher through a metal sieve with a very thin towel, cheesecloth or through a nut milk bag. 
4. Transfer to a sealed container and refrigerate for up to 7 days.
