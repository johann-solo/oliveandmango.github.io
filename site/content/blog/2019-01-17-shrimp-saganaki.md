---

A quick and easy sheet pan dish made of tender spiced and herbed shrimp baked with tomatoes, garlic and feta and finished off with a squeeze of lemon juice and fresh herbs.  It’s the perfect dish served as an appetiser or a full meal either with pasta or orzo, rice, or just crusty bread to scoop up the flavourful sauce right out of the pan. It’s typically made in a large frying pan or skillet on the stove top or bakes in a casserole dish, but I decided to make it into a sheet pan dish resulting in a quicker cooking/baking time and minimal prep time.

When I first made this for my husband he looked a bit confused as he was expecting bubbling cheese in a pan to be served on the dinner table not saucy shrimp. You may feel the same way as most people think sagananki should be followed up by a loud OPA and a shot of something potent being poured into a hot pan with cheese and then poof - a burst of flames. That is definitely the the most common dish people associate with saganaki. Saganaki in Greek actually refers to the two-handled dish or frying pan the dish is typically cooked in. So you see saganaki can be associated with many other foods other than the cheese it’s so famously known for. This dish has three main components to it - the tomatoes and aromatics, the shrimp and of course the feta. They all come together beautifully in this dish - now let me tell you more about them!

### To use fresh or canned tomatoes?
Not that big of a dilemma actually. It’s completely up to you whether you use fresh tomatoes or canned. You can even use larger chopped fresh tomatoes in place of cherry tomatoes. Approx 4-6 medium sized tomatoes would do in place of the cherry tomatoes. Really and truly this dish works well with whatever you have on hand. If tomatoes are in season definitely use them and if not use canned whole tomatoes or canned cherry tomatoes. If using whole ones just make sure to choose them up into smaller pieces. If you are using canned try to use good quality canned tomatoes which enhance the flavour of the dish. If I can get fresh I will always use fresh because I love the taste of roasted fresh tomatoes. Choose fresh herbs over dry where and when you can especially in this case when the fresh herbs are tossed in and on after the dish has been cooked as they add so much to the dish. If you like an extra bit of freshness you can even toss some fresh dill to the herb mix to add some more vibrancy to the dish. Make sure that your tomatoes, garlic, and onions are well seasoned with salt and pepper as each layer adds to the whole dish.

### How to get the most delicious shrimp? 
This one is easy guys. I toss mine well with the spices and let them hang out, while I chop my veggies and seasonings and make sure that each of them are fully coated with seasoning. They get a few minutes of marinating while I prep and it’s literally like they are getting a nice flavour bath. Shrimp don’t need a lot of time to absorb the flavours that they are marinating in, so that quick little ‘bath’ will ensure they are covered in flavour and bake up deliciously! I always buy shrimp that has already been peeled and deveined but still has the tail on – makes for a prettier presentation and I find my family is much happier that they don’t have to peel the whole shrimp when they are served. I usually have frozen shrimp on hand at all times. It’s so versatile and cooks up so quick. Either frozen or fresh works great with this recipe. Just be sure that when you use frozen shrimp, make sure to thaw them out completely and pat them dry with a paper towel before placing them in the marinade. They cook/bake up quickly which is great for a quick meal.

### Should I have dairy with seafood? 
Scientifically there is no proven reason why you should avoid having the two together. This traditional Greek dish (in good company with many creamy pasta shrimp dishes) disregards the notion that seafood and cheese don’t mix and it works beautifully resulting in a delicious balance of flavours. Make sure and use a good quality feta and one that you like. Some like a softer brinier feta and others like harder more crumbly feta. You can use anyone one you prefer. There are slight variances, however, in flavour and texture, depending on what type of milk is used (cow, sheep or goat) and where the feta is made. What you use boils down to taste, and availability. I’m not picky when it comes to feta and neither is this dish.

I love serving this dish with my lemon parsley orzo. It goes really well with the flavours of the shrimp and I’m a sucker for pasta. We could have eaten this right off the sheet pan with crusty bread though and next time we may just do that. If you are a shrimp lover I know you are going to love this dish. Trust me on this one and definitely give it a try.

* <span itemprop="ingredients">4 garlic cloves, minced</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">Salt and pepper to taste </span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">2 cups cherry tomatoes or 1 can (14½ oz.) tomatoes, drained and finely chopped</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">½ tsp crushed red pepper flakes (or more according to taste) </span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">½ tsp sweet paprika</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">1 - 1½ pounds large shrimp, peeled and deveined (thawed if frozen)</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">½ cup of Greek feta cheese, crumbled plus more for serving</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">1 tsp dried oregano</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">2 tbsp each roughly chopped mint and parsley plus extra for garnish while plating</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">Lemon slices or wedges for serving </span>

__For the lemon parsley orzo__

* <span itemprop="ingredients">1 tsp salt</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">8 oz. orzo pasta (about 1⅓ cups)</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">2 tbsp butter</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">1½ tsps lemon zest</span>

* <span itemprop="ingredients">2 tbsp fresh parsley, minced</span>


### Directions
__For the Shrimp Saganaki__

1. Preheat the oven to 425°F.
2. Toss shrimp with chili flakes, paprika and oregano, 2 tbsp of olive oil and set aside
3. Arrange cherry tomatoes, garlic and onion on a rimmed baking sheet, then drizzle with remaining olive oil and toss. Season with salt and pepper.
4. Arrange shrimp over tomato mixture in one layer.
5. Crumble cheese over surface
6. Roast until the shrimp are opaque and the tomatoes begin to burst, 10-15 minutes depending on the size of shrimp (smaller ones will cook faster than the larger ones) If you want a little extra colour on your shrimp you can put the oven on broil for the last minute or two of baking (no more as you don’t want to overcook your shrimp) until the edges are golden. Remove them from the oven and finish them with a generous squeeze of lemon juice and sprinkling of fresh mint and parsley along with extra cheese if you would like.
7. Serve with salad, bread, or pasta. I served mine with lemon parsley orzo and it was fantastic.

__For the lemon parsley orzo__

1. In a large saucepan, bring 1 quart (4 cups) of water to a boil.
2. Add the salt and orzo and cook until the orzo is tender and has absorbed almost all of the cooking liquid, 8 to 9 minutes.
3. Drain any remaining liquid then stir in the butter, lemon zest and juice and parsley and set aside while making the Shrimp Saganaki.
