<span class="blog-text">

This strawberry rhubarb French toast is stuffed with lemon ricotta filling made with fresh ricotta cheese and lemon curd - and then baked until golden and crisp. It’s the perfect overnight baked French toast for spring and summertime celebrations. It’s easily prepared the night before and baked the morning of. It’s bursting with big flavors of fresh strawberries and rhubarb and refreshing lemony notes.

This baked French toast casserole can be made with just about any berry or fruit and also any combination of fruit too. It can be made with fresh or frozen fruit as well. The edges and the top is slightly crispy. The juicy, sweet berries and rhubarb is a great compliment to the custardy dish as is the lemon curd and ricotta filling. SO DELISH. This thing will feed a crowd or you’ll have plenty of leftovers. NOT A BAD DEAL AT ALL.

## Strawberry rhubarb lemon ricotta French toast ingredients: 
* Ricotta: It has a sweet, milky taste, and a mild aroma. It goes so well with lemon.  A good substitute would be softened cream cheese. 
* Lemon curd: It gives the filling its lemony flavours and adds to the creaminess of it too.   You can use your favorite brand of store bought lemon curd, though we highly recommend making your own - my simple <span class="highlight"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.oliveandmango.com/how-to-make-a-simple-no-fail-citrus-curd">no fail lemon curd </a></span> is delicious and easy to make! 
* Bread: Day-old, crusty bread is perfect for french toast casseroles. I prefer challah bread. But any bread will work like French bread,  croissants, brioche, sourdough, or white bread.  Slice it up and let it sit out all day. Or if it’s fresh give it a quick toast in the oven at low heat to dry it out. 
* Milk: For the best flavor and texture, I prefer using whole milk. You can use any milk, dairy or non, but keep in mind the casserole won’t taste as rich with lower fat or skim milk.
* Eggs: Are essential for the custard and the perfect binder. 
* Maple syrup: I love to use it as a sweetener in this recipe and over the finished casserole. But feel free to use honey or sugar instead if you wish. 
* Fruit: I love the classic Strawberry rhubarb combo but any berry or any fruit will work. Fresh or frozen fruit works well in this recipe.

## How to make stuffed French toast
For this Ricotta French Toast, all the work happens the night before. Start with a loaf of French Brioche Bread or any bread you might have and a good quality ricotta cheese!
* Slice your bread - I usually love to slice it into cubes. Layer half of it a greased baking dish. 
* Make your ricotta cheese mixture: Mix together ricotta, lemon curd and a pinch of salt. Slather mixture over layer of bread.
* Layer with fruit 
* Place the rest of the bread over fruit 
* Make the custard filling by whisking eggs with the milk, maple syrup, vanilla and pinch of cinnamon. Pour mixture over the French toast. Sprinkle with a dusting of coarse sugar/turbinado sugar or coconut or cane sugar, cover and bake.

The next morning, before your guests arrive, before the kids are up or while you make the coffee - pop the pan in the oven and bake. It will be ready and on the table in no time. And just the smell of it baking will get everyone out of bed.

## How to serve baked French toast:
Serve hot with powdered sugar and fresh strawberries! I like adding a bit of crunch with some flaked almonds too. Maple syrup is always an option as well. If you liked this recipe you will love these ones too:

### Direction
1. Grease a 9×13 baking dish. Place half of the bread cubes evenly in the dish.
2. Whisk together the ricotta, lemon curd and salt until until smooth. Spread mixture evenly over the bread cubes. 
3. Sprinkle fresh or frozen strawberries and rhubarb evenly over the ricotta mixture. Top with remaining bread cubes evenly.
4. In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, vanilla extract, cinnamon, and maple syrup. Slowly and evenly pour egg mixture over entire casserole, ensuring that all bread cubes are soaked. Cover tightly and chill for at least 4 hours or overnight.
5. Remove dish from fridge and let sit at room temp while you preheat the oven. Sprinkle with some turbinado sugar if you wish. Preheat oven to 350F with rack on lower middle position. Loosely cover with foil and bake 30 minutes. Uncover and bake another 30 minutes or until center is firm and top is quite puffy and golden brown. Let rest at room temp 15-20 minutes to allow custard to set before serving. 
6. Slice and serve with whip cream, sliced almonds, extra berries and maple syrup

### Recipe Notes
* Leftovers: Keep in the refrigerator in an airtight container for a few days. Reheat in microwave or oven. 
* CAN I USE FROZEN BERRIES? Yes! Substitute fresh berries with frozen berries if fresh berries are not available.
* Bread: Day-old, crusty bread is perfect for french toast casseroles. I prefer challah bread. Slice it up and let it sit out all day. You’ll wind up with about 12 cups of cubed bread. A little more or less is OK.
* Milk: For the best flavor and texture, I prefer using whole milk. You can use any milk, dairy or non, but keep in mind the casserole won’t taste as rich with lower fat or skim milk.
* Half Recipe: This french toast casserole recipe can be halved and baked in an 8 or 9-inch baking pan. The bake time will be slightly less, around 30-35 minutes.
* For freezing: Prepare the recipe through step 4 and freeze for up to 2 months. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator then bake as directed. Baked casserole can be frozen up to 3 months. Thaw in the refrigerator and warm up in a 350°F for 35 minutes or until warm in the center.
