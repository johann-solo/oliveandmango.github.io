This is a wonderful and easy recipe for pecan bars that includes a simple shortbread bottom and a one bowl mix & pour topping loaded with pecans. This tasty recipe is from The Bite Me Balance Cookbook. I was happy to review Julie Albert and Lisa Gnat’s newest cookbook and i thought you guys would love this recipe as much as I do that is why I chose to highlight this one out of the 138 original recipes from book.

The book is full of very approachable recipes that are perfect for everyone from amateur to the well seasoned home cook. The ingredients are fresh and simple and the focus is on quality making each dish fabulous. The book highlights the importance of balance when it comes to healthy eating, something I am very much behind. I don’t follow any particular diet (gluten free when it comes to pasta only and easy on the diary), ofcourse if your health dictates a certain diet that is a whole other story,  but when it comes to regular day to day eating I’m very much about balance and making smart choices when it comes to what we put into our bodies but allowing some indulgence.

The ladies have coined a phrase that is a perfect reflection of their sense of humor - “Moderation is the granny panties of the diet world”.  They are not cool and trending but they do the job- (I said that) “It really comes down to a lifelong commitment to eating smarter and moving more” they add  and I couldn’t agree more. The book is filled with wholesome daily eats and delectable occasional treats like these delicious and easy pecan pie bars. The recipes are 75% healthy and 25% butter.  The book itself is broken into four sections: Breakfast and Brunch, Lunch, Weeknight dinners, as Gatherings. The recipes are written clearly and in a concise manner. There are also tips included for each recipe along with some fun quotes along the way.  It’s well written and the photography is beautiful. It’s bright and vibrant just like the personality of these two sisters.

When it comes to these pecan pie bars - we can’t get enough of them.  They are the perfect make ahead treat and freeze very well too.  They are way easier to make then a traditional pecan pie and make enough to share.  These sweet, sticky, salty, crunchy and nutty bars are definitely a crowd pleaser and the best pecan bars we have made. The ratio of crust to filling and pecans is perfect and you really can’t beat a recipe that comes to gather quickly and easily.  This is one of the many delicious recipes in the _Bite Me Balance Cookbook_. From smoothies to Lisa’s famous biscotti - there’s something for every meal and everyone.

### Ingredients
#### Pecan Pie Filling

* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup brown sugar</span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">5 tbsp flour</span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 tbsp cornstarch &ast;</span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tsp kosher salt</span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">6 eggs</span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 cups corn syrup</span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">6 tbsp melted butter</span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tbsp vanilla extract</span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 cups coasrsely chopped pecan halves</span>

#### Shortbread Crust

* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 cups flour</span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">&frac12; cup icing sugar</span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tsp vanilla extract</span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">&frac12; tsp kosher salt</span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup melted butter</span>
</br>
</br>

### Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Coat a 9-by-13-inch baking pan with nonstick cooking spray and line with parchment paper, extending the paper over the edges for easier removal.
2. For the pecan filling, in a large bowl, whisk together the brown sugar, flour, cornstarch and salt until there are no lumps.
3. In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs, corn syrup, melted butter and vanilla. Add the liquid mixture to the dry mixture and whisk until combined. Let the mixture stand while preparing the crust.
4. For the crust, in a large bowl, stir together the flour, icing sugar, vanilla and salt. Add the melted butter and stir until combined. Press the dough onto the bottom of the prepared pan. Poke the crust with a fork 5 or 6 times in different locations to prevent air bubbles. Bake the crust in a preheated oven for 20 minutes, until golden.
5. Stir the pecans into the pecan filling and pour the filling evenly over the crust. Bake at 350°F for 45 minutes until the filling is just set; the centre should be a little wobbly but not runny. Cool completely, refridgerate and chill at least 2 hours before cutting.

### Recipe Notes

&ast; Light or dark corn syrup can be used; the dark syrup gives more colour and a deeper flavour.  

</br>

* It’s very important to let the mixture stand for about 15 minutes while the bottom layer pre-bakes. This gives the flour time to soften and help thicken the top layer. You also do not need the bottom layer to cool before pouring in the filling. Pour on the topping while the crust is still hot.

* Cutting these without crushing the layers can be tricky.  The key is to break through the pecan layer first then the rest is wash. To do this I use a sharp serrated knife to help cut or saw through the pecans. Once you have cut through those gently cut through the two other layers evenly. Then cut one entire row off at a time and then cut each row separately into whatever size slices you prefer.
