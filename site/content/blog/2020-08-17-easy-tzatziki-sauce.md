This creamy tzatziki is a classic Greek garlic yoghurt dip or suace made from thick strained yogurt, cucumber, garlic, olive oil, and fresh dill. It’s super simple to make and irresistibly good. This is so tangy full of bright flavors and delicious; a very versatile sauce. You can use it as a dipping sauce for breads or vegetables, on souvlakia, gyros, or as a condiment. It’s also great with rice almost like a Greekstyle raita.

It’s so easy to make and homemade is always best as you can customize it to your liking. The grated cucumber is optional but adds a freshness and a really nice texture. The fresh herbs are also optional but I strongly recommend as they add even more flavour to this yummy sauce. I definitely insist on straining the yoghurt - it makes all the difference. You can skip straining the cucumber cause you can use your hands to squeeze the liquid out of the cucumber, but you can’t really do that with the yoghurt. This requires just a bit of planning. I usually strain mine overnight.

This is in fact a Greek-style garlic sauce so expect it to be quite garlicky. You can cut back the garlic to 1 clove if you want it less garlicky but really and truly the longer the garlic rests in the yogurt, the less sharp bite it will have and the better it will taste. It’s Fresh and flavorful, and an easy Tzatziki recipe. It’s so good you’ll want to drizzle it on everything (or eat it by the spoonful).

</br>
</br>

### Ingredients

* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">One 750 gram container of Greek yoghurt strained in a cheesecloth over a metal strainer and bowl over night </span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Juice of &frac12; lemon depending on how lemony you want it (I usually go for all)</span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tbsp olive oil</span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 cloves garlic, peeled and grated</span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">&frac12; of a cucumber washed, peeled and grated and the excess juice squeezed out (this is totally optional — I don’t always add the cucumber but it adds a cool freshness to it)</span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">&frac14; cup of a combo of freshly finely chopped dill and parsley </span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Salt and pepper to taste </span>
</br>

### Directions

1. In a bowl mix all ingredients together and season with salt and pepper to taste and enjoy the garlicky goodness that is tzatziki!! Allow the flavors to blend in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes before serving. The bright and tangy flavor of tzatziki are best when served chilled
2. Tzatziki should last about 5-7 days in the refrigerator, but you’ll find so many amazing ways to use it up, it will be gone long before that.
