The first sign of rhubarb at the grocery store or in your garden calls for a simple yet irresistible almond rhubarb tea cake. Tender crumb, crispy edges with just enough sweet and a nice tartness from the rhubarb. It’s buttery but not too rich, the perfect spring time dessert to enjoy with tea or coffee.

I love tea cakes like this with loads of almond flour or almond meal in them. I have a [strawberry one on the blog](https://www.oliveandmango.com/strawberry-almond-tea-cake/) that is also so delicious that I know you will love . It gives the cake a really delicious, distinct flavour and texture. It’s light, tasty with a nice crumb and it’s not too sweet which is actually quite dangerous - expect to eat a few slices at a time or be warned - either way.

My go to almond flour is as you know by Bob’s Red Mill. <span class="highlight"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.bobsredmill.com/almond-meal-flour.html">Bob’s Red Mill Super Fine Almond flour</a></span> is made from California grown almonds, great for gluten free baking and perfect for paleo and grain free baking recipes as well. The texture it gives things is always pleasing and I also love the slight nuttiness if adds to anything you bake with it including this almond rhubarb tea cake. Bob’s Red Mill has all the products you need for all your baking needs while catering to those in your family who have specific food allergies. Their flours come in stone-ground, whole grain, organic, gluten free, paleo, and vegan options, perfect for any spring recipes.

I have never used frozen rhubarb with this recipe so if you decide to I would limit the amount to no more than a cup of sliced and frozen rhubarb. Frozen fruit always adds more moisture to a cake and adding 1 pound of frozen rhubarb to this cake would definitely not work. The sugar in the recipe that you sprinkle over the rhubarb stalks before it bakes seems like a lot but use all of it - I promise you you won’t regret it. It gives the top of the cake a golden crunchy crust and it caramelizes the rhubarb stalks as well. It’s a simple cake that requires just a few minutes of patient mixing to get the butter whipped and fluffy but apart from that it’s so easy to whip up and I know you will enjoy it! Hope some of your spring rhubarb finds it way into this cake. Enjoy!

### Recipe
### Ingredients

* <span itemprop="ingredients">1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, room temperature</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">¾ cup plus 3 tablespoons sugar, plus more for pan</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">1 pound rhubarb stalks, trimmed</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">1¼ cups of <span class="highlight"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.bobsredmill.com/unbleached-all-purpose-white-flour.html">Bob’s Red Mill Organic Unbleached All-Purpose White Flour</a></span></span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">1 cup of <span class="highlight"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.bobsredmill.com/almond-meal-flour.html">Bob’s Red Mill Super Fine Almond flour</a></span></span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">1 teaspoon baking powder</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">¾ teaspoon  salt</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">1 tsp vanilla paste or 1 tsp vanilla extract </span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">2 large eggs</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">¼ cup plain Greek yogurt or sour cream</span>

### Directions

1. Preheat oven to 350°F. Grease 11x8" tart pan/baking pan or 10"-diameter tart pan with removable bottom or skillet (I lined my pan as well for easy removal of cake) 
1. Slice rhubarb in half lengthwise (quarter if the pieces are very large). Set 8 of the prettiest ones aside to decorate the top of the cake; chop remaining rhubarb into ½" slices. 
1. In a medium bowl whisk together the flour, almond flour, baking powder, and salt.
1. Place 1 cup butter and ¾ cup sugar in a large bowl along with the vanilla paste. Using an electric mixer on high speed, or a standing mixer, beat until light and fluffy, about 4 minutes. Add eggs, one at a time, beating to blend first egg before adding second. Beat until mixture is pale and fluffy, about 4 minutes.

1. Reduce speed to low and gradually add dry ingredients, then the yogurt. Beat, just until combined, scraping down the sides of bowl once or twice (batter will be thick). Fold in chopped rhubarb and scrape batter into prepared pan. Smooth batter and arrange reserved rhubarb over top; sprinkle with remaining 3 Tbsp. sugar.

1. Place tart pan on a large baking sheet and bake, rotating once, until cake is golden brown and rhubarb on top is soft and beginning to brown, 60-70 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack and let cake cool for at least 10 minutes and then remove rim or lift out of pan with parchment paper and allow to cool completely
