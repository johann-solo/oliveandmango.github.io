These crispy cheesy pierogi baked with veggies and sausage are such a great way to have dinner on the table with zero fuss. A quick and complete meal and one that is so easily customizable. I know I can always rely on frozen pierogies being in my grocery cart. My family loves them and they are so handy to have in the freezer. You can use any flavour filling you like when choosing your pierogies for this recipe. The pierogies and veggies get tossed in a bit of olive oil and some spices right on the sheetpan. Caramelized onions with pierogies is my all time favourite way to enjoy pierogies. In this sheetpan version the onions bake until caramelized and instead of bacon another classic pierogi pairing you have sausage. A little meatier and more substantial.

## Are pierogies better pan fried or baked?
I always thought I loved my pierogies pan fried but that was until I tried them like this roasted on a sheetpan. A totally different pierogi experience. They sort of puff up and get crispy all over. They are so good. The crispy exterior with the soft cheesy middle makes them irresistible. It was hard to say how many servings this dish really makes - are you a 1-2 peirogies per sitting kind of person or an 4-6? We lean towards the 4-6 per sitting but we are good eaters. They go down super easy - just a heads up.

## The key to really good sheetpan dinners
It doesn’t get easier when it comes to dinner thanks to the sheetpan. The key to really good sheetpan dinners is making sure you give everything, all ingredients their own piece of sheetpan real estate. For things to really get golden crisp they need to be hitting the pan not layered over top of other ingredients. If you over crowd things like I did in my prep shot (shot just for a visual of all ingredients together) things will definitely cook but things may not get as crispy or cook as evenly. I ended up baking mine in two pans. If you have a very large pan that is great too that way everything is touching the pan while roasting.

I mentioned this recipe is versatile and customizable. You can definitely switch up the veggies and even the spices you use. A nice harissa seasoning would be delicious with the veggies or even maybe a southwestern spin on the seasoning - I can easily see that for breakfast - pierogi chilaquiles anyone?!?! How am I only now thinking of that? I’m definitely trying that next time! (More substitutions below) You catch my drift - you choose the seasoning and you get yourself a great quick and easy sheetpan dinner that everyone in the family will love!!
