I’m a huge fan of rice crispy treats! They never get old and I’m not opposed to the sugary marshmallow ones either on occasion. But how good is it when you can make your rice crispy treat a healthier one that packs the protein as well and is gluten free. Even better is that these guys are made up of only 5 ingredients. The dates add texture, sweetness and a caramel flavour to the treats and they also help bind the ingredients into bars.

The butter does the same as the dates but also adds a wonderful nutty flavour and lots of good fats and protein. The nut or seed butter if you are using, also adds a richness or decadence to the treat that makes them more of a dessert than a snack – but having them on any occasion is quite acceptable.

The brown rice puffs are gluten free and actually additive free – they are literally just plain old puffed rice. They add as you know from any rice treat the best kind of crisp and crunch. Together combined, these ingredients make the most addictive snack that is so simple to whip up. A favourite in our house and know you will love them too.

* &frac12; cup of nut or seed butter of choice (I usually do peanut butter or almond butter)

### Directions

1. Line a 8-9inch square baking pan (small brownie pan) with parchment paper and set aside

1. Place dates in a heat proof bowl and soak in boiling water for about ten minutes

1. While dates are soaking put the almond butter and maple syrup into a food processor.  Drain and add the dates to the food processor and process until smooth and thick like caramel

1. Dump out the creamy butter into a large bowl and pour in the puffed brown rice in and stir really well until it’s a sticky mess

1. Transfer the puffed rice mixture into it and press it down until it’s a smooth flat layer.  Put in the fridge or freezer while you melt the chocolate

1. Melt the chocolate on very low heat in a small pot or in spurts in the microwave until it’s pourable.  

1. Remove the puffed rice from fridge and pour the melted chocolate evenly over it and smooth it as needed. Top with a sprinkle of your choice of chopped nuts and some flaky sea salt and refrigerate until the chocolate has completely hardened then chop into slices and enjoy

### Recipe Notes

Tip: if you have trouble getting everything to hold together you can incorporate a little more of the nut butter into the mix. Have no fear though once cold they will hold just perfectly.
