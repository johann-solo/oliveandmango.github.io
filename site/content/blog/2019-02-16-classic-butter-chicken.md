Butter chicken is one of those classic Indian dishes that most are familiar with and love. It’s ones of my husband’s favourite and I love it too. I have made quite a few versions but many times they are lacking in flavour, the texture is not right it, or they are way to complex to even try or have me motivated to try again. In comes _My Indian Kitchen_ by my talented Insta friend and author _Swayampurna Mishra_. I was so happy to get a message from her asking for my address to send me a copy of her new cookbook. I was super excited to receive it as I have been a huge fan of her work (blog and photography) since I joined the foodie insta family.

I have always been drawn to her and the likes of her as she is a wonderful writer and story teller. Something I’m lacking and so I find especially endearing in others. She is also super positive as a person and very much empowered and empowering. She tells it like it is and I totally admire that in people. I was very proud and excited of and for her when she announced her book. What’s amazing about the book is that her photography is all unmistakably her own. Not only her recipes and her beautiful writing, but her beautiful images are all her. Really this is a special book. Her 2nd little baby next to D.

It arrived and I first went through and enjoyed all the photography, as it tells a story on its own. Then I took my time and checked all the recipes and bookmarked all the ones that I wanted to make and - there are a lot of them. I hear her voice clearly throughout the book, through her recipes and notes and her introduction. The book is so well put together starting with starters or appetizers ranging from simple to opulent and to desserts and drinks, with many delicious things in between. The titles of her chapters are so her as well. From Beginnings to My sweet life and Let’s drink - they all capture her and her voice.

I have also always been drawn to Swayampurna because of her love of food and her food relationship.  In this way we are similar and have a wonderful love for even basic foods and joy in even simple eats. Although our food experiences and cultures are different our love and appreciation for food from a very young age is very similar. And who doesn’t love to be around someone else who loves and enjoys food? It’s in us. I have only met two people in my life (sadly I’m sure there are more of them in this world) that would rather take food in a pill form than actually eat it - could not relate to them and that is why I can fully relate to Swayampurna and her book of delicious Indian dishes. Her book is an invitation into her kitchen, introducing you to Indian cuisine, something that may seem intimidating to some.  She simplifies it and shows you how anyone can do it and enjoy it and share it with loved ones.

I chose butter chicken, actually I should say my husband chose the recipe that I was to make to feature on the blog as it’s his favourite and a no brainer to try. I thought it was also a perfect recipe to share with you guys on the blog because I know you love comforting dishes and thought you would love a staple butter chicken recipe, and guess what? That is what this one is. Look no further, this is it! The flavours, textures and spice is all on point. You will absolutely love it and will have it on repeat and I’m so happy I get to share it with you guys. Definitely give it a try and do check out _My Little Indian Kitchen_ by _Swayampurna Mishra_ for more of her delicious recipes.

### Recipe notes from Swayampurna
The gravy will keep in an airtight container in the refrigerator for 3 days and in a resealable bag in the freezer for 3 months. If you are storing the gravy, follow the directions as outlined up until adding the cream. When reheating gravy, bring it to room temperature and resume the directions at the point of adding the cream. Be sure to add an extra dollop of butter.

### My notes
__Marinade__

I like to marinate the the chicken for a half an hour up to overnight before cooking. For the marinade I used a squeeze of lemon or lime juice, a pinch of salt, pinch of red chili powder or paprika, a tsp of kasuri methi, a pinch of turmeric, 1 tsp of garam masala, a splash of oil, 1 clove of garlic and a 1/2 inch piece of ginger grated, and 1/2 cup of Greek yoghurt. Simply whisk the ingredients together, toss the chicken in it and cover and refrigerate. I think this intensifies the flavours in the chicken. The marinade is very similar to the one Swayampurna uses in her Yogurt and Saffron grilled chicken Tikka.

__The sauce__ 

I made it ahead of time (the night before i cooked it) and I found that I didn’t need to strain mine as it was super creamy. My high speed blender did an amazing job but if you find yours isn’t as smooth definitely strain it. Making the sauce ahead and marinating the chicken the night before makes this super easy to prep in advance and reduces the cooking time by so much. I strongly recommend it especially if you are planning on making this for a dinner party. 
</br>
</br>

__The chicken__

I already told you about the marinade but one thing I like to do is pan fry and brown the chicken a little bit before. I remove the chicken from the marinade and pan fry it in 1 tbsp of oil before adding the butter, asafetida and sauce in the pan. You can also grill the chicken as Swayampurna recommends for added flavour before adding it to the sauce. 
</br>
</br>

__Substitutions__

Green chili = jalapeño 
Kashmiri red chili power = paprika/cayenne combo 
Asafetida = onion garlic powder combo 
Kasuri methi = fresh chopped celery leaves and fennel combo is the closest
