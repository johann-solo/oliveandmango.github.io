Easy to make and full of flavor, this grilled flank steak is one of my favorite summer grilling recipes. An easy marinade gives this flank steak a robust flavor--resulting in melt-in-your-mouth tender, juicy steak with a hint of sweetness. The seasonings are subtle enough that leftovers work in a variety of recipes  - tacos, salad, fried with eggs - you name it.  I love to serve mine with chimichurri sauce a side green salad like my [Classic Greek Lettuce Salad (Maroulosalata)](https://www.oliveandmango.com/classic-greek-lettuce-salad-maroulosalata) and my [Greek-style potato salad](https://www.oliveandmango.com/greek-style-potato-salad). Simple delicious and perfect on the grill or stovetop - more on that below.

## What is flank steak?
It’s the cut of beef that comes from the abdominal area - it can be a bit chewier than some because of the area it’s cut from but when cooked and sliced properly it’s quite tender and full of flavour. Flank steak is generally one of the least expensive cuts to purchase and really great for fajitas and tacos and steak salads or grilled and enjoyed just like this with a side of whatever you like. It doesn’t require a lot of time to cook this cut of meat making it a great option for a quick and delicious meal.

## Do I have to marinate flank steak? 
It’s not a necessity, but most people prefer to marinate flank before, regardless of the cooking method. The salt and acidity of a marinade can help tenderize the meat in addition to providing extra juicy flavor. I recommend it. A few hours can make a difference. I chose a marinade with several ingredients that I love. The combo is my absolute favorite for flank steak. It results in a tender juicy steak with a hint of sweetness. It’s a marinade that suits any sauce - don’t let the soy sauce fool you.  Soy sauce in marinades always gives meat a savory boost enhancing their flavour, and balancing out the rest of the flavours in the marinade. It’s not only in Asian inspired dishes.

## Do I have to grill flank steak? 
My favourite way to have flank steak is grilled but that is definitely not the only way to cook flank steak. You can pan-fry it stovetop on a grill pan or skillet on high’ish heat to get that sizzle going. You can also broil it in the oven or roast it on very high heat - it will take no time to cook that way too - We are talking minutes. The key with high heat is to make sure and not over cook the steak. Be mindful of that and when in doubt use a thermometer to check it. Pull the steak off the grill or out the pan/oven at 120 to 125°F for RARE, 130-140°F for MEDIUM RARE, and 145°F for MEDIUM. Flank can also be cooked low in slow in a slow cooker making it even more tender. It’s quite a versatile cut of meat.

## How do I slice flank steak? 
You might often see ‘slice against the grain’ when it comes to flank steak and other cuts of meat. This is talking about the direction of the muscle fibers. Notice the direction of the muscle fibers of the steak; this is called the grain of the meat. Flank steak is a very lean cut that will be tough and chewy unless you cut it in a way that breaks up the muscle fibers. So, cut the steak across the grain of the meat, at a steep diagonal, so that the slices are wide. Flank steak is probably the easiest cut of meat to be able to see the fibers clearly making easier to slice against the grain.

## How to grill flank steak
This is done quite easily with just a few steps: 
* Marinate the flank 
* Preheat grill on high and grease grates 
* Place flank on grill and grill for 3-6 minutes then flip once and continue to grill until done according to your liking. 
* Allow steak to rest 10-15 off the grill 
* Slice against the grain and enjoy with the chimichurri sauce

## What do I serve flank steak with?
It’s often served with chimichurri sauce which is the Argentinian pesto with the addition of some tang. It’s commonly made with chopped fresh parsley, oregano, garlic, olive oil, vinegar, and red pepper flakes. I added some mint to mine and some lemon juice as well - putting a slight Greek twist to it. It’s perfect with the flank but you can serve it with whatever sauce you like. I mlike to serve this flank with a side fresh salad and or potato salad. It makes for the best meal. It really works with any side. Leftovers are perfect reheated as well. Leftovers are why I tend to undercook mine. This flank steak is soooo good the next day pan fried and served with eggs and hot sauce.  I also love to tuck some into a pita or wrap or use the leftovers in tacos or salad.

### Directions
#### Marinate the steak
1. Combine the marinade ingredients in a large bowl. 
1. Place steak in the bowl and turn to fully coat and cover bowl. (You can also place the steak and marinade in a freezer bag)
1. Chill and marinate for 4-12 hours. 

#### Make sauce
1. Combine the garlic and vinegar in a bowl. Stir in the parsley, oregano, mint, and lemon juice, zest and chili flakes if using. Whisk in the olive oil. Season with salt and pepper. 
2. Mix well and set aside at room temperature to allow the flavors to marry. Alternatively, you can put all ingredients into a Food processor and process for a few seconds. No need to chop the ingredients if using food processor. Leftovers can be refrigerated in a sealed container for up to two weeks. 

#### Grill
1. Preheat a grill or stovetop grill pan over medium high to high heat. Lightly grease the grate.
1. Remove the steak from the marinade and gently shake off the excess marinade from the steak. Season with salt and pepper if desired. 
2. Place the steak on the grill and cook undisturbed for 3-6 minutes. Flip once and continue cooking until it reaches your desired level of doneness. For medium-rare, cook the steak until it reaches an internal temperature of 130°F.
3. Remove steak from grill onto cutting board and allow to rest tented with foil for 10 min. 
4. Slice steak against the grain and serve with chimichurri sauce and lemon wedges

### Recipe Note
* If you would like to turn the excess marinade into a sauce you can, instead of discarding. Pour excess marinade into a small sauce pan and bring it to a boil, simmer for several minutes, and serve it with the flank steak.
