excerpt: A delicious classic literally with a twist
---

I came across this cake watching Zoebakes IG stories.  I spoke about her before on the blog and am a huge fan of her IG stories. Anyways she did a banana version of this one with the cream cheese filling and with a fabulous meringue frosting which she decorated with the most perfect peaks of meringue. I don’t have a blow torch or whatever you call it (the kitchen friendly one) so I didn’t dare try to make it. I was too chicken to broil it in the oven so I decided to do a classic cream cheese frosting instead.  You see, I made this for a little Instagram group cook off featuring carrots organized by a fellow blogger over at *squaremealroundtable* and *whatsannieseating* and so I wanted to get it right the first time. This is Rebecca’s 4th  online collaboration featuring a single ingredient and this one is all about the carrots. Make sure to check out the clever hashtag they created #24carrotgoals on Instagram to see all 70+ other collaborators and their carrot creations.

When I saw Zoe make *Smittenkitchen’s* banana roll cake I thought straight away it would be perfect as a carrot cake roll. So I made the purée which as you see in the recipe is super easy to make and deliciously sweet. The trade off worked deliciously and I’m so happy my little noggin was working that day and thought to do this swap and so glad I was brave enough to make it too. This is why I appreciate Deborah’s cook book challenges (rainydaybites). They broaden my skills and encourage me to try new things I would normally stay away from - like this cake roll or roll cake (as you can see I will be using those interchangeably through the post so I apologize in advance). We did do one of these roll cakes on one of her recipe challenges and thought - yes this is totally doable - and it TOTALLY was.  So if I can do it you can.

This cake was fun to make. Zoe’s step by step videos really really helped. I hope that I conveyed the instructions well through my pics. I definitely tried to but I know that videos are seriously better when it comes to instructions. Hopefully I will be incorporating those in the future.  Videos are a whole other ball game - not quite ready to tackle them. I’m only now getting the hang of blogging, so I hope the step by step pictures are helping for now.

We loved this cake and I think that it’s a great and fabulously fancy way of serving carrot cake. If you haven’t tried making a roll cake this should totally be your first. It bakes so quickly and if you follow the baking temperature and time and the rest of the recipe carefully it’s a great success! So definitely read through the whole recipe before you start. The cake itself is very light and airy and the cream cheese filling and frosting are not overpoweringly sweet. They complement each other beautifully. It’s not something out of the ordinary. You are going to get the same delicious flavours of a classic carrot cake but just jooshed up a bit in the form of a roll cake that looks so delicate and is fun to make and serve.

I feel like I did a lot of name dropping in this post. Just giving credit where credit is due and  totally love to be inspired by woman who truly know their food and especially their baked goods. I’m not a desert person - I’m a chocolate person.  Chocolate is my dessert. But doing these challenges and trying new baking recipes has really opened my eyes and mind to a whole new level of dessert. I’m loving it and so is my husband.  Anyways moral of the story - always push yourself to try new things when it’s comes to the kitchen and cooking.  You really truly don’t know what you’re going to like unless you try it.

### Ingredients
<br>

**For the carrot purée**

Makes approx 1 cup of purée

* 2-3 large carrots peeled, and sliced very thinly
* Water - just enough to cover the carrots by 1 inch

**For the cake**

* 3 large eggs
* &frac13; cup brown sugar
* &frac13; cup sugar
* &frac23; cup of carrot purée
* 1 tsp pure vanilla extract
* 2 tsp bourbon (optional)
* 1 tsp baking soda
* &frac14; tsp salt
* &frac34; tsp cinnamon
* &frac14; freshly ground nutmeg
* &frac14; tsp ground all spice
* &frac34; cup of all purpose flour
<br>

**For the cream cheese filing and frosting**

* 2 8oz package/ of cream cheese
* 4 tbsp of butter
* 2 tsp vanilla extract
* 1&frac12; cups of powdered sugar
* &frac14; cup of chopped walnuts and shredded coconut to sprinkle over the cake
<br>

### Directions

1. Place carrots and water into a small saucepan with a lid. Begin heating on high so water starts steaming quickly, then reduce heat to medium and continue steaming until carrots are tender and there is little water left in the pot. Carrots take a bit longer to cook than some other vegetables, so keep an eye on them. Add a splash of water if they start to dry out.

1. Once the carrots are super tender drain any excess water if needed, transfer them to a blender or food processor, and blend until smooth. Allow to cool then transfer to a sealed container and can be stored in the fridge for a couple of days.

1. Preheat the oven to 350&deg;F

1. Grease a 10x15 or 11x16 sheet pan/jelly roll pan and line with parchment paper and grease parchment paper as well and set aside

1. Beat the eggs with a mixer fitted with a whip attachment until foamy.  Slowly add the sugars and continue to mix for another 8-10 minutes until the eggs are creamy and smooth and as Zoe describes are the colour of cappuccino and until they reach the ribbon stage.

1. Add the carrot purée, vanilla and bourbon if using and mix just until incorporated.

1. Add the spice mix, salt, baking soda and salt and mix again until just combined

1. Stir in the flour with a spatula or unattached whip attachment from mixer until just combined

1. Spread batter evenly over the pan and bake for 10-12 minutes until set. No longer or else it will dry out and crack while rolling it later

1. Remove from oven and immediately run a knife around the edges of the cake, lay a clean damp towel over the cake, invert it onto the underside of another pan or over a cooling rack and carefully peel the parchment off the cake

1. Place a clean sheet of parchment over the cake and roll the cake with the towel in place starting from the short end and away from you and allow to cool rolled up while you make your frosting

1. Beat the cream cheese, butter, vanilla and powdered sugar until creamy and smooth

1. Unroll the cake on a flat surface and peel off the parchment paper.

1. Spread half the frosting evenly throughout the cake. Then roll the cake back up over the filling using the towel to help refrigerate it  

1. At this point you can roll it onto plastic cling wrap and wrap it and refrigerate until ready to ice or ice it immediately when rolled with the rest of the frosting.

1. Once frosted sprinkle with chopped toasted walnuts and coconut flakes slice and serve
