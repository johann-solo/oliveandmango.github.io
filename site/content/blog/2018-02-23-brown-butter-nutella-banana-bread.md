excerpt: Enjoy swirls of sweet nutty, cocoa flavours in your banana bread

You heard butter is better and that’s true but what’s even better is nutella. What’s even better than one or the other is combining the two in this banana bread.  This recipe combines those two things with yet another loved thing in our home - banana bread! Banda bread is one of those baked goods that I never tire of and is pretty hard to mess up if you have a good recipe. This banana bread is a spin on my classic recipe which yields a crowd pleasing loaf every time. It’s a pretty basic recipe that I have been using and adapting recipes from for years.

Ok let’s get down to the nitty gritty of this recipe! First off why brown butter? Not because I wanted a hipster banana loaf in my recipe log, but because brown butter gives everything a delicious caramel’y sweet nuttiness. I also find it amplifies all the other flavours in baked goods.  It also smells amazing when you make it – I have to hold back from having more than a taste while making it.  If you don’t want those flavours in your bread no problem just melt the butter and carry on as normal with the recipe. If you have never tried it and are intimidated, don’t be! It’s basically just slowly over melting your butter.

Let’s talk briefly about the Nutella. Very briefly cause not much else to say other than I would add it to everything if I could and that’s why it was necessary in this banana bread. I actually have a long list of both chocolate and Nutella things I want to make for the blog but they are on the back burner cause I know I post way too much chocolate or Nutella stuff. I’m trying to widen out a bit. But if you are also a fan - don’t worry I have not gone off them just pacing myself with the chocolate Nutella posts. They’re coming......

I love the swirls of Nutella through the bread and over the top of it too.  The bread smells heavenly while it bakes and it’s really hard not to tear into it right out of the oven.  Neither flavours overpower but blend well together. You definitely taste and smell a cocoa component and a warm nuttiness too, both from the brown butter and the Nutella. This could easily be made with the addition of toasted hazelnuts and some chocolate chips or chunks. How fabulous would that be? It would give it more texture, crunch and flavour.  Will definitely be trying it that way the next time!

### Ingredients 

* &frac12; cup of butter (1 stick) 
* 1 tsp of instant espresso/coffee powder (optional but recommended)
* 2 cups all-purpose flour
* 1&frac12; teaspoons baking soda
* &frac12; teaspoon salt
* 4 overripe bananas
* 1 cup brown sugar
* 2 large eggs
* 2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
* &frac14; cup of milk at room temperature 
* &frac14; cup nutella plus more for drizzling over your bread later. 

### Directions

1. Place the butter in a small saucepan set over medium heat and cook until the butter turns a deep golden brown color, about 2 minutes; stir in the espresso powder. Remove and let cool slightly.

1.  Preheat oven to 350&deg;F grease a loaf pan.

1. In a large bowl, combine the flour, baking soda, and salt; set aside.

1. Mash the bananas with a fork in a large mixing bowl then add the brown sugar and mix together with a hand mixer for a good 3 minutes; you want a light and fluffy banana cream. 

1. Add the melted brown butter and coffee mixture, butter, eggs, milk and vanilla; beat well and scrape down the sides of the bowl. 

1. Mix in the dry ingredients just until incorporated; no need to overly blend.

1. Heat the nutella in a microwave for about 20 seconds to soften it and make it a little more pourable then drizzle &frac23; of the nutella over the banana bread batter.

1. Using a rubber spatula very gently fold the nutella into the batter, trying not to over mix, so you can see the swirls when it is baked.

1. Carefully pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan without mixing the batter to much to keep the swirls in place. Add the rest of the nutella and swirl into the batter.

1. Bake for about 45 minutes to 1 hour until golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center of the loaf comes out clean. Don't get nervous if the banana bread develops a crack down the center of the loaf; that's no mistake, it's typical. Rotate the pan periodically to ensure even browning. And tent with foil with bets cut into it if it starts getting to brown at the edges. 

1. Cool the bread in the pan for 10 minutes or so, and then turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely before slicing.
