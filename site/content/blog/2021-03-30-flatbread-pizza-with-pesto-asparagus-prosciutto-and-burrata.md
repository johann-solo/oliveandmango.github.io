This is the perfect spring flatbread pizza, with asparagus, peas, prosciutto and delicious creamy burrata. I have been anticipating the warm weather, sun and all the veggies and it’s finally here - well almost. It’s officially spring but the weather and sun have some catching up to do. The best parts of spring include all the green veggies I love and this flatbread is one of my favorite ways to showcase and enjoy them. This makes a great meal or even an appetizer perfect for the midweek or date night too.

If you like pizza like I do you will really like this flatbread pizza. I love any kind of pizza but I have a soft spot for thin crust. At least once a week we are eating pizza or flatbread pizza of sorts. This particular one is a fun one I made in partnership with Bob’s Red Mill and their new <span class="highlight"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.bobsredmill.com/shop/grain-free-flatbread-mix.html/?utm_source=TheOliveAndMango&utm_medium=influencer&utm_campaign=bobsredmill">Grain Free Flatbread Mix</a></span>. It’s a great mix to have on hand if you want to make a grain free flatbread pizza at home. It’s simple to make and only requires a few basic add ins. It has a subtle nuttiness and sweetness to it that actually plays off really well with the spring veggies. Bob’s Red Mill always has you covered with so many grain free options for baking and cooking for all your dietary needs.

## How to make this easy flatbread pizza:
* Blanch the asparagus and the peas 
* Make the lemony pesto base sauce with homemade or store bought pesto
* Combine all the ingredients for the flatbread, allow to rest then split dough in half and press out into 6-8 inch rounds. (You can also use store bought flatbread, naan, pitta bread or pizza dough) 
* Brush pesto sauce over the flatbread rounds 
* Scatter asparagus and peas between the two flatbread evenly 
* Bake in a preheated oven until flatbread is golden 
* Once out the oven place the burrata on top along with the prosciutto, slice green onions, arugula and chili flakes
* Drizzle with remaining pesto sauce, slice and enjoy.

The burrata gets even creamier form the warmth of the pizza making it extra irresistible. This spring flatbread pizza has the tastiest combo of flavours - from the lemony pesto sauce, creamy burrata, tender veggies, salty prosciutto and a hint of heat with the chili flakes. It’s super easy to throw together and just the most perfect thing to make anytime but especially on a busy night. Enjoy!
