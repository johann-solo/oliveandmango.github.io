excerpt: A 'power' salad that is substantial, delicious and filling

You may have never guessed this about me because I’m a lover of veggies and all things green but I hate making salad. I love eating it, and I do make salad all the time, but making it and prepping a salad is up there with cleaning chicken for me in the duties that I hate doing. It’s meticulous work, lots of chopping and I really can’t explain it but it’s not my favourite.  I’m sure you may feel the same about them sometimes. Isn’t it the greatest feeling when someone makes you a salad. I guess it’s a great feeling when any food gets made for you but for me salad is at the top of that list. I do still have to make them because they are my favourite thing to eat, but just thought I would share. I’m sure some can relate.

Anyways, I can’t say I have a favourite salad because there are so many textures and flavours of salads out there that I love.  I love a simple Marosalata (simple green style chopped lettuce and herb salad) to a fully loaded with fruits and nuts and seed and of course I could never pass up a yummy herby bean salad either. This salad is in the category of a loaded salad.  Lots of beautiful layers of flavours and textures.

A friend of mine use to make a very similar salad and I saw two people I follow on Instagram make it as well and I just had to have it. My friend Irene from the Spicy Olive and Liren from the Kitchen Confidante. Both beautiful salads and I used some of Liren’s  techniques and especially loved the roasted garlic in her recipe.

I love the slight chewy texture and nutty flavour of the farro and the roasted squash has a mild sweetness that is always intensified when roasted. The roasted garlic just amps up the flavour not only in the salad but the dressing as well.  I love kale and it was perfect in the salad.  It holds up against the dressing really well. You could use spinach as a substitute but it will definitely wilt and may get a little mushy but it still would be a good alternative green in the salad if you were looking for one. Just serve and eat it quickly. Hee hee! Or you could just not dress it. Keep the dressing on the side and you can add it per serving. If you don’t like farro or don’t have any you could also use brown rice as an alternative.

I love using za’atar spice blend in my dressing. It’s aromatic and a little tangy too from the sumac in it. I love herby additions to my salads and dressings. I am Greek after all and we love our oregano heavy salads! Thyme is not a stretch and that is actually what za’atar means in Arabic and is comprised of.  A mix of thyme, sesame seeds and sumac. Adding the feta was a total no brainer too for the same reason stated above – feta and salads just work. Rephrase that – feta + everything = just work (Greek math).

Basically this salad is pretty awesome and you need it in your life is what I’m trying to say. A few things that you could add to give it more texture would be dried cranberries, toasted nuts or seeds and possibly some chopped fresh herbs. I think all those things would be great add-ins and can be added according to how loaded you want your salad. You most definitely should give this a try. It’s filling and fabulous and you will love it! Enjoy!!
