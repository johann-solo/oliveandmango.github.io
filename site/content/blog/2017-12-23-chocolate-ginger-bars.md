excerpt: Chocolate ginger bars with a fudgey icing and sprinkled with some homeade crystallized ginger
---

In the winter months, whether I’m here or back home I always get a hankering for some spice. Whether it’s in my tea, latte or in something sweet like these bars. From pumpkin spice to ginger spice I love them all. How do you make them better? By adding chocolate obviously!

These bars are full of ginger and spice and lots of chocolate chewiness. The addition of molasses adds loads of that delicious brown-sugar flavour to them and since it attracts moisture (like honey), baked goods made with molasses stay moist and chewy like these bars.

What makes these a little over the top is the fudgey icing. It adds another layer of texture. The bars are chewy on their own then the chocolate chips add another texture to each bite, then there’s the fudgey chocolate icing layer and let’s not forget about the slightly crisp and chewy crystallized ginger pieces. So you get the point. Loads of flavour and loads of texture in these.  I loved making my own crystallized ginger. It’s so easy to make and the recipe makes enough to reserve a stash to help a future headache or soothe a sore throat.

I would say that these are definitely not for the faint of heart. These are for those who like their flavours big and bold. I am a huge fan of gingery sweet things and strong molasses flavoured baked goods. So it’s a go big or go home kind of treat you’re in store for if you make these. If you like all those things you won’t be disappointed. And even if you don’t – trust me there something about these little guys that for some reason will keep you going back into the fridge for more. So give them a try and enjoy.
