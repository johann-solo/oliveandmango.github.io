You all know I love soup. One of my favorites is a classic chicken and rice soup which I crave all through the winter. I already have a fabulous classic chicken soup on the blog but I wanted to make a richer creamier version thus the creation of this one.

It’s richer in flavour from the bacon and the addition of cream as well. I would reserve the regular chicken and rice one for when you are feeling under the weather and chose this one for when you want a heartier soup that is a little more luxurious when it comes to richness and flavour.

The beauty of this soup is that it is perfect for using leftover rotisserie chicken or leftover turkey, or chicken you've pulled from the bone after making homemade chicken stock. It calls for basically the equivalent of 2-3 chicken breasts (depending on the size of them) if you wanted to roast some up especially for this recipe. To do that all you have to do is drizzle the chicken breasts with 1 tablespoon of the olive oil. Then sprinkle with a dash of each of the dried spices and bake at 375 ° F in a preheated oven until the chicken is cooked all the way through, 15 to 20 minutes or until cooked through. Remove it from the oven. Cut the chicken into cubes or strips and set aside until ready to add to the soup. It’s an extra step but if you have no leftover chicken or turkey it’s worth making just for this soup recipe.

This recipe can make either a thicker soup or a thinner one. I like mine a little on the thinner side and a bit more brothy as I usually have leftovers and the soup gets progressively thicker as it sits in the fridges overnight. You might want to thin it out slightly with more cream or water when reheating it. So the thicker you initially make it, the thicker it will be when you reheat any leftovers. If you like a thick soup than use less broth. Start with 8 cups of the broth and see if you like that consistency. If you do, stop adding broth at that point, and if you want it a little more runny keep adding more up to the 10 cups. A lighter version of this soup would be to use milk in place of cream or ditch the milk all together if you don’t to dairy and just use a little extra broth.

This makes quite the pot of soup and is great for company. It’s my favorite to make for a nice Sunday lunch on a cold day with a big loaf of country style crusty bread and maybe a glass of Pinot and then off to bed for a Sunday afternoon nap afterwards. The beauty of it is it doesn’t take long to make at all especially if you are using up some leftover turkey or chicken and it makes such a delicious bowl of comfort food that you will be craving days after you finished it all off. Its loaded with veggies and lots of chicken and I love the bite and texture the wild rice adds to it too. It’s rich and delicious and I know it will be a hit with your family!!
