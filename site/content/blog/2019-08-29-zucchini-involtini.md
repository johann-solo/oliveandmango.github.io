Involtini is an Italian dish that consists of a filling (often cheese) that is rolled up in some type of outer layer (beef, chicken, vegetables, cured meat etc). Eggplant is a very popular choice for for this meal but I thought I would use zucchini - also popular. I had plenty of zucchini to use and saw a fabulous recipe on _Food52_ site which I had to make. I kept close to the recipe expect I made my own sauce for it which is so simple to whip up and so delicious and I also used spinach instead of chard in it to keep things simple and it was also what I had in the fridge.

I love that the zucchini slices are roasted and not fried making it a bit lighter. We made this for dinner one midweek evening and although there are a few steps involved in making it, they are all super simple and totally doable even in the midweek. That being said, I am a multitasker and I don’t mind a recipe with a few steps. But this one can also easily be made ahead. The whole thing can be made and wrapped and stored in the fridge until you are ready to bake it (I wouldn’t keep it in the fridge for longer than a day) or what I like to do is roast my veggies and prep the sauce the day before and then the next day I just need to fill roll and bake. You could also use a store-bought sauce to make it even easier and one less step.

This is a very delicious vegetarian meal but very easily made vegan as well using my favourite flavourful vegan ricotta recipe. I included it below and it is totally perfect for this recipe if you are looking to keep it dairy free. The creamy ricotta filling - vegan or regular makes this dish rich without being overly heavy probably because the ricotta is wrapped not in pasta or meat but roasted slices of zucchini.

This is one of those meals that you can literally take out of the oven, set on the table with a few forks and spoons and crusty bread and that is all you need! The sauce is fabulous and deserves to be mopped up with crusty bread after each zucchini roll-up disappears from the pan- trust me they disappear quickly. This will be on repeat all through zucchini season. If you love zucchini make sure to check out the [zucchini salad](https://www.oliveandmango.com/shaved-zucchini-salad-with-a-lemony-vinaigrette/) I just posted and do stay tuned for one of my favourite zucchini loaves coming to the blog soon - in the meantime try this [Chocolate Chunk Zucchini Bread](https://www.oliveandmango.com/chocolate-chunk-zucchini-bread/).

## Recipe
</br>

### Ingredients
__For the Zucchini__

* <span itemprop="ingredients">2-3 medium zucchini thinly sliced lengthways (approx 20 slices) </span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">2 tablespoons olive oil for drizzling </span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">Salt and pepper to taste </span>

__For the Sauce__

* <span itemprop="ingredients">1 onion, diced</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">1 tablespoon olive oil</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">3 cloves garlic, minced</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">&frac14; tsp chili flakes (optional)</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">2 tablespoon tomato paste</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">400 gram can tomatoes and their juices </span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">Salt and pepper to taste </span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">A large handful of basil leaves, finely chopped</span>

__For the Filling__

* <span itemprop="ingredients">1&frac12; cups ricotta cheese</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">4 sprigs of fresh thyme</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">Juice and zest of 1 lemon</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">2 tbsp chopped fresh parsley </span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">8 oz fresh or frozen spinach (frozen must be thawed and squeezed dry)</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">Salt and pepper to taste </span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">1 clove of garlic minced </span>

__For the Garnishes__

* <span itemprop="ingredients">Freshly grated Parmesan cheese </span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">Chopped fresh basil and or parsley </span>

### Directions 

1. In a large sauté pan over a low heat, sauté onions in olive oil until translucent. (I like to use one that is oven-safe that way I can bake the eggplant rolls right In the same pan) Add the garlic, Italian seasoning and chili flakes if using and sauté for another minute. 
2. Add all remaining sauce ingredients and leave to simmer for 30 minutes or until thickened breaking up the tomatoes with a wooden spoon. Pour sauce into a baking dish and set aside or if using the same pan to bake the zucchini rolls in just set it aside. 
3. Preheat oven to 425°F. Line two sheetpans with parchment paper. Trim the stem end of each zucchini. Stand each vertically, and make &frac14;-inch thick cuts down to create long slices. Arrange the slices on the prepared sheetpans. Drizzle them with the olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Transfer to oven and roast for 15 minutes. 
4. Remove pans from the oven. Use a fork or spatula to flip each zucchini slices over, return pans to the oven, and roast for 5 minutes if needed. Once done the zucchini should be cooked enough to easily roll. Remove pan from oven and set aside. The cooking times will vary depending on how thinly you slice your zucchini. 
5. While the sauce is simmering and zucchini is in the oven, in a large sauté pan set over high heat, heat the tablespoon of oil until shimmering. Add the garlic and spinach leaves, season with a pinch of salt and pepper, and sauté for about 2 minutes or until wilted. Remove pan and set aside to cool 
6. To make the filling, in a medium bowl, stir together the ricotta, lemon zest, thyme, and &frac14; teaspoon salt. When spinach has cooled, stir it into the ricotta mixture. Season well with salt to taste. 
7. Place a spoonful of filling at one end of each of the zucchini slices. Roll the slice into a tight coil and place it seam-side down in the dish or pan on top of the tomato sauce. Transfer to the oven and bake until the sauce has reduced slightly and is bubbling, and the rolls are lightly golden on top, about 25 minutes. If the rolls are still not golden after the 25 minutes. broil for the last couple of minutes if not as golden as you would like them to be. 
8. Remove and serve with grated Parmesan cheese and garnished with fresh chopped basil and or parsley
