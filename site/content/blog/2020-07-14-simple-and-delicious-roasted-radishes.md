Roasting radishes is not only easy but a delicious way to enjoy them. Roasting them mellows their peppery flavor and turns them into a whole new root vegetable. They make the perfect side right out of the oven but I also love to toss them with a vinaigrette and some feta and fresh herbs for a light meal or side salad.

Yes - Radishes aren't just for pickling or salads anymore. This abundant, very colourful and very inexpensive veggie makes a great side to any meal. Raw radishes are crisp, crunchy and peppery, that can be eaten on their own or added to salads and I love them that way. But when you roast them, something magical happens. They soften, get tender and loose their peppery taste and instead become surprisingly sweet, while maintaining a slight kick at the end.

## Are the radish tops edible? 
They are edible. Using the green radish tops adds color and amps up the radish flavor. Be sure to rinse the green tops thoroughly before using them. They have a peppery bite and are fantastic quickly sautéed with olive oil and salt, or turned into a pesto. They are also great in salads when mixed with other greens and perfect chopped up and added to this salad as well. Ofcourse the greens should be fresh enough to use. If they aren’t just leave them out of the recipe. It happens - sometimes you have good intentions of using them as soon as you buy them but then forget and by the time you get to them the greens have lost all their life.

I love these roasted radishes in salad form. Tossing them with a simple vinaigrette makes them taste even better. I have a [fabulous vinaigrette](https://youtu.be/wlYtBpLq3Ok) that is my go-to that Johann calls the ‘fancy dressing’ (it’s really not that fancy) because I actually put effort into it and add more than olive oil and lemon juice to it and this is a version of it below. The one below is simple - requires no chopping of anything and  still has a little more complexity to it then just lemon juice and olive oil alone. You can really dress these radishes with just about any dressing you like or might have on hand but I am partial to lemony dressing or vinaigrette.  You can also add different herbs to them and even toss the radishes with dried herbs before roasting just like you would if you were roasting potatoes or carrots. They really are a versatile veggie. If you haven’t tried roasting them I strongly recommend.

### Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 400°F. Trim the tops and from the radishes (reserve the greens for this salad or another use) and cut the the radishes into halves (or quarters for larger ones)
Toss radishes with the olive oil, salt, and pepper. Place in a large baking dish and roast for 20 to 25 minutes until they are tender. 

1. Make vinaigrette while radishes are roasting. Place all of the vinaigrette ingredients together in bowl or jar and and whisk/shake them  together. Taste and adjust for salt or pepper to  preference. (Makes more than you will need to dress - leftover keeps well refrigerated for several days) 

1. Once the radishes are out of the oven, allow them to cool for a few minutes before assembling salad. (If not using right away they can also be cooled completely and refrigerated for up to 5 days if making ahead.)

1. Combine the roasted radishes and crumbled feta in a salad bowl, and toss with a tablespoon or two of the vinaigrette. Taste and toss with additional dressing as needed. Sprinkle mint and chopped radish tops if using  over the salad and toss to combine. If the radishes are still warm, the herbs will wilt; this is normal and will infuse more flavour to the salad. 

1. Salad can be served warm or room temperature. Leftovers will keep for a few days refrigerated.
