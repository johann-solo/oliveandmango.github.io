## What do you need to make these asparagus ham and cheese puff pastry bundles: 
These little tasty bundles are so versatile. There are so many ways you can adjust the recipe to suit your taste and also according to what you have on hand. Here is what you will need. 
* Puff Pastry - you can use any kind or brand you like or even your own if you make puff pastry yourself.  You can also use crescent rolls if you prefer a softer pastry bundle. Crescent rolls don’t get those crispy edges like puff pastry does.
* Grainy mustard & Honey/or your favorite honey mustard - I love my ham and cheese sandwiches with mustard and I had to add a layer of it to these bundles. It’s optional but recommended - I added the honey for some sweetness to balance out the savoury and salty from the ham/prosciutto and the cheese. 
* Ham - I chose to use prosciutto but you can use any thinly sliced ham or deli meat like Turkey breast, salami, mortadella, you name it - whatever you like. I like to do 1-2 slices per bundle. You can adjust according to taste. 
* Asparagus- choose either thin or thick spears according to taste 
* Cheese - this is a fun one because you can choose whichever one you like. I love Gouda in my puff pastry treats and I also had loads of it on hand so I used that but you could use a nice old cheddar, Parmesan cheese, Brie and even a spreadable herbed cream cheese or Boursin 
* Everything bagel seasoning - this is my favorite way to top these but sesame seed will work too, or an extra sprinkling of cheese, or you can just leave them plain too. If your seasoning blend has salt in it use it sparingly to avoid making them overly salty

## How To Make Asparagus Ham & Cheese Puff Pastry Bundles
They are very simple to make - make sure to watch the video of how to make them for any assistance.  
* Start by preheating your oven and lining a baking sheet with parchment paper. 
* Toss the asparagus, with the olive oil, salt, and pepper to taste. 
* Roll the pastry out on a floured surface or piece of parchment paper. Then cut it into 8 squares with a pizza cutter, depending on the size of your pastry sheet. 
* Next spread the puff part with honey mustard motive, followed by the ham then the asparagus and lastly the cheese. Fold 2 wedges in, brush with egg wash and then bake until golden.

## Problem tips for your puff pastry: 
Puff pastry works best when it's cold. It's easier to handle when it's cold and it bakes up nice and puffy when it's cold. This mean you'll have to work quickly when making these. I like to keep one sheet of puff pastry in the fridge while I work with the other. Then while I'm baking the first round of bundles, I'll roll out and assemble the rest of them. If it is too warm, it will be difficult to work with, and it won’t puff up as much during baking. If using frozen puff pastry, be sure to thaw it to fridge temperature, but not to room temperature.
If you're making these bundles ahead of time, make them according to the recipe directions, but skip the egg wash. Place them on a parchment lined baking sheet cover them tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate them immediately. When you're ready to bake them, remove the plastic wrap, brush on the egg wash and bake them according the recipe directions.

The flavors of these are so tasty. The salty prosciutto and cheese balance the flaky, buttery puff pastry crust and the crisp, yet tender asparagus just brings the whole dish together. I just love them for springtime when the asparagus is abundant. Enjoy.
