## Easy to make Greek roasted chicken and potatoes
I absolutely love a meal like this for family dinner, meal prep or even a midweek meal. I love that both the chicken and the potatoes are cooked together. The drippings from the chicken melt into the potatoes and caramelize in all the good flavor from that lemon herb marinade. Don’t let the word marinade fool you it’s more of a dressing than a marinade - the chicken needs no marinating time just brush this on your chicken before roasting. No basting required either so it’s really a set it and forget kind of meal.

## How to make moist and tender roasted chicken
The one important thing that you must do is dry brine the chicken with salt - basically salt it  and then let it rest. Salting the inside and the outside of the uncooked chicken flavors and tenderizes it, and also contributes to a deliciously crispy skin. Just pat the skin dry and salt then allow the salted chicken to rest uncovered in the fridge for at least an hour or 24 is even better. I usually do overnight if I remember cause it’s so easy to do. If I forget I just salt it out of the fridge while I’m prepping the marinade and slicing the potatoes. This lets the skin really dry out, so that it cooks up extra crispy in the oven.
</br>
</br>

It’s really that easy. What gives this whole meal a kick start is roasting it in a preheated pan - this helps speed up the cooking process and gets the potatoes extra crispy. Just make sure to be very careful when removing the hot pan from the oven and when placing the oil bird and potatoes in the preheated pan. It can sizzle quit a bit so keep that in mind and keep a safe distance.

Once it’s roasted either transfer the chicken and the potatoes onto a serving platter or do as we do serve right from the skillet so you can dip into all the fabulous tasting drippings. Enjoy!

* <span itemprop="ingredients">1½ pounds russet potatoes, scrubbed, thinly sliced crosswise</span>

__For the herby marinade__

* <span itemprop="ingredients">2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">Juice from 1½ lemons</span>

1. <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">In medium size bowl whisk together the marinade ingredients and set aside </span>
1. <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Pat chicken dry with paper towels and season generously with salt, inside and out. (We use 1 tsp. salt per lb.) </span>Tie legs together with kitchen twine. Let sit 1 hour to allow salt to penetrate, or chill, uncovered, up to 1 day ahead.
1. <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Preheat oven to 425°F. Place the oven rack rack in upper third of oven and set a 12" cast-iron skillet or a </span>3-qt. enameled cast-iron baking dish on rack.
1. <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Meanwhile, toss potatoes, with 3 tbsp of the marinade. </span>
1. <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">Once oven reaches temperature, pat chicken dry with paper towel and brush with remaining marinade. </span>
