There’s nothing more comforting than a hot stew when the temperatures are freezing outside. Adding cheese and puff pastry to it and baking it off until its bubbling makes it even better. It’s the end of February and everyone keeps talking about spring but Spring has definitely not sprung in this part of the world yet. It’s been super cold and we just got another healthy dumping of snow. So meals like this are definitely in order.

## Easy to Guinness pie using the Instant Pot
I was looking for a good Guinness pie recipe and came across <span class="highlight"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.marthastewart.com/1511473/guinness-pie">Martha Stewart’s</a></span>. I loved it so this is my rendition of her recipe made in the <span class="highlight"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://instantpot.com">Instant Pot</a></span>. It makes making a pie like this super easy and cuts down so much on the cooking time. Instead of it braising for hours it cooks in the Instant Pot for 20 minutes and then bakes with the puff over it for another half hour. I have been getting more and more use out of my Instant Pot the last few months as we have been shooting content for companies that showcase recipes using it. So I thought I would incorporate a few recipe on the blog with options to make the dish using the Instant Pot. I have included braising instructions below if you wanted to make this on a slow Sunday on the stove top enjoying the smell of it braising away for a couple of hours - either way is delicious.

## What makes Guinness pies so good
I love adding beer to roasts and stews. I’m such a fan of the extra add ins that give meats like this one and their sauces so much flavour. I have a brisket chili recipe my brother inspired on my list to test soon that not only has Guinness in it but also coffee. Doesn’t that sound incredible!!? Guinness Beer gives this sauce an incredible rich, deep flavour, and the beef is fall-apart tender and is so delicious enveloped in cheese - yes cheese (optional but recommended) and buttery puff pastry. Let’s go back to the cheese shall we. The smoked cheddar adds even more depth of flavour and richness to this pie plus as an added bonus it also acts as a slight barrier between the filling and the pastry allowing the puff to crisp up well and stay crispy longer. Expect me sharing a few more cozy meals like this on the blog and perhaps a few more using the instant pot! Enjoy and stay warm!

* <span itemprop="ingredients">1 lb of Cremini mushrooms sliced </span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">1 tbsp of Dijon mustard </span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">2 cups of stout beer </span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">3 cups of beef broth - plus &frac14;-&frac12; cup extra as needed </span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">1 bay leaf </span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">5-7 springs of thyme </span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">3 tbsp Water </span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">2 tbsp cornstarch or arrow root powder</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">1 package frozen puff pastry thawed </span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">6 ounces extra smoked cheddar (optional) </span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">1 egg whisked well for egg wash </span>

### Directions
<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">

1. In a large bowl combine flour, salt, pepper, onion powder, and garlic powder then add meat and toss until well coated. 
2. Browning the meat: (browning the beef is optional but adds lots of flavour to the overall dish) Set the Instant Pot to SAUTE, add the oil and bacon and sauté until browned then remove with a slotted spoon and set aside. Add beef to pot and brown the beef on all sides. Meat will not be cooked through, you may have to work in batches. Transfer browned meat onto a large plate.
3. Add onions, garlic and the rest of the veggies ecept for the potatoes and sauté for a minute or two adding a little broth to help deglaze if pan gets dry. 
4. Add the beef and bacon back into the pot along with potatoes, bay leaf, beef broth, thyme, Dijon mustard, stout beer and stir to combine making sure to scrape the bottom of the pot very well releasing all the brown bits and adding extra broth if needed. This is critical as to avoid BURN message on IP. (See Notes below)
5. Cover and seal the lid and set to 20 minutes with High Pressure. Allow the pressure cooker to release naturally once done for at least 10 minutes then quick release any remaining pressure. Once release is complete, remove the top. Adjust seasonings with salt and pepper if necessary (discard bay leaf and thyme). 
6. THICKEN STEW: Make a slurry by whisking 3 tablespoons of cool water with 2-3 tablespoons cornstarch or flour (all purpose, gluten free, arrow root starch)  Set the Instant Pot to SAUTE add the slurry and allow the stew to come to a boil and thicken up. Then go to Preparing the Individual Guinness Mushroom Beef Pies or One Large One 
7. Preheat oven to 400°F. Empty beef stew into one large baking dish. I used a 9 inch dish and made the rest in smaller individual sized ones. A 12 inch cast iron skillet would work really well too or a 2&frac12;-quart baking dish and place on a rimmed baking sheet. Sprinkle cheese over meat filling if using. 
8. On a floured work surface, roll out dough to a diameter approx 2 inches larger than baking dish or dishes. Center dough over filling; trim edges to about 1-inch overhang (it's okay if it's a little uneven). Brush egg wash over bottom of edges, and press to baking dish to seal. Brush remaining egg wash over top of pie. Cut vents in centre. Bake until crust is golden brown and the filling bubbles, 35 to 45 minutes. Let cool 20 minutes before serving.

### Oven braised instructions

1. Dredge beef in flour and spice mixture as above. 
2. Heat oil in a large heavy bottom pot or dutch oven over medium. Add bacon and cook until crisp and browned, Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. 
3. Working in batches, cook beef until browned on all sides, about 4 minutes per batch. Using a slotted spoon, transfer beef to a large bowl. 
4. Add onions and garlic and the rest of the veggies except for the potatoes and sauté for a few minutes. If bottom of pot begins to burn or onions begin to stick, stir in about &frac14; cup of the remaining broth.
5. Return beef and broth to pot. Add remaining bacon, stout, thyme, and bay leaf. Bring to a boil, scraping brown bits from bottom and sides of pot
6. Reduce heat and simmer partially covered, stirring occasionally, 1 hour 30 minutes.
7. Add potatoes. Cover and simmer until potatoes are tender but not mushy, about 25 minutes. Remove and discard bay leaf and thyme. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer to a 2&frac12;-quart baking dish and place on a rimmed baking sheet. (Filling can be made up to 2 days ahead and refrigerated. Bring to room temperature before baking.)
8. Proceed with rolling out puff pastry and baking as above 

### Recipe notes

If Instant Pot shows BURN notice that usually means either there isn’t enough liquid in the pot or that there are too many brown bits at the bottom of the pot that need to be released - otherwise they read as burned food to the IP. Simply depressurize the IP add more liquid and scrape the bottom well - replace lid and continue cooking.
