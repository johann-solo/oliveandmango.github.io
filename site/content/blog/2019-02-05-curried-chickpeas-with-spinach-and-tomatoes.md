This curried chickpea and spinach dish is uncomplicated, quick to whip up and so tasty. 
When the temperature drops and the air has that chilly bite, this is the perfect way to warm up. This quick curried chickpea recipe is warming, hearty, delicious and just the simplest dish to make. We make a version of this once a week especially if I’m home from the office late - it’s super quick to make and ultra satisfying. You can use whatever your favorite curry blend is. You can use a homemade blend or prepared one. I love using Thai curry in this recipe but any curry blend works.

## How to make curried chickpeas with spinach?
Once you have your curry blend it’s as easy as sautéing your aromatics, then simmering the spinach and the chickpeas in a tomato based sauce until they are tender and sauce has reduced. The spices are fragrant and delicious - and are really what make this dish what it is. The chickpeas are super satisfying and the spinach is packed with nutrients. It’s in the ‘curry in a hurry’ category of curries and perfect for a quick and easy midweek meal that can easily be enjoyed with rice or flatbread or both.

I finally got this recipe on paper and on the blog in collaboration with the Mc Master Silhouette (Hamilton’s university newspaper). I was asked to share a ‘student-friendly’ recipe with simple ingredients that are easily accessed by them. This is definitely one of those recipes. It was featured on the front page of the newspaper and the full recipe was included in the inside article along with some very kind words by the editor about the blog and our work. I think the students will love it and I know you will too! Here’s the link to the article online if you wanted to check it out.

It also freezes marvelously so that is even more reason to make a little extra to add to your freezer stash and meal prep roster.

This is a great staple recipe made with mostly pantry items. It’s one of those back pocket recipes that’s great to pull out when you have very little time to prep a meal or when you are tempted to order take-out but don’t want to spend the money and want a low effort but delicious meal. It is also so versatile too. If you wanted to make it creamier you could add some coconut milk to it and if you did want to add meat you could do that too. All you have to do it sauté it separately or first before adding the onion, garlic, chili and ginger. You could add more veggies or replace the spinach with kale too. There are many ways you could doctor this up to suit your taste. That’s why I call it a staple basic recipe that is fabulous as is but that you can also get creative with so give it a try and have fun with it!

### Recipe notes
* To freeze, portion out into meal prep containers, cool completely, then freeze for up to 2 months. Thaw overnight in the fridge, then reheat until steaming hot in the microwave or stove top.
* To add some creaminess to this dish you can serve it with a dollop of yoghurt, or you can swirl in some cream or coconut milk to the dish right before it comes off the heat for extra richness.
