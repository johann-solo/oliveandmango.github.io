excerpt: Spring is in the air with this simple asapargus side dish

Spring is in the air for many and asparagus totally reminds me of spring. These guys are perfect as a side on their own or can even be enjoyed tossed with a lemon garlic pasta. Either way they are tender, nutty flavoured from that delicious brown butter and have slightly crisp edges from the grill!

You most definitely can use regular butter or even substitute it for olive oil but I think it’s worth making the brown butter for that extra bit of flavour.

Being back home and with my folks affords me the opportunity of gleaning from their garden. As my dad had been off his feet for a bit though, it’s sort of slim pickings. There is the usuals that pop up it seems every spring without much care or planning and I was so happy that he has so much wild garlic growing and popping up. I clipped som scapes and added them instead of the garlic.

If you don’t know what scapes are don’t worry either did I, or at least didn’t know the name for them. They are basically curly, deep-green stalks or shoots that grow from garlic bulbs. They are a bit like asparagus in texture, but have a distinct garlicky taste that's a little milder than the bulbs.  They are delicious and even more so grilled. I thought they would be perfect in place of garlic in this recipe and I was right. I usually use garlic so please do if you don’t have any scapes to use.

You can also eat the asparagus straight out of the foil package without really grilling them but I like the slightly charred or grilled delicious edges you get from grilling them. You can also cook them in the oven in the foil packet and then broil them open for a couple minutes too or bake them on a baking sheet instead. Either way you make them, they will be delicious! I’m going to enjoy them in all sorts of ways while they are fresh and in season and a great price!!

### Ingredients

* 1&frac12; lbs. of asparagus washed and trimmed
* 2-3 tbsp butter
* 1 clove of garlic chopped
* Juice of &frac12; a lemon divided in half  

### Directions

1. In a small pot melt butter over medium heat and let it bubble for a few minutes swirling it in the pot a couple of times, let it continue to cook until it changes colour to a darker yellowy-brown, smells fragrant and nutty, and there are little brown flecks at the bottom of the pot. I use it just like this but many prefer straining the butter to get the brown bits out  (I love the nutty flavour they add)

1. Heat up your grill and clean the grates as needed

1. In the meantime place the asparagus over two large pieces of foil, drizzle with half the lemon juice, the brown butter and top with the garlic, tent and seal the edges of the foil to allow the asparagus to steam up on the grill

1. Place the asparagus in foil onto the grill and close and let it grill for approx 8-10 minutes depending on how thick the asparagus is.

1. Carefully take the package of asparagus off the grill on to a cutting board or plate (I slide mine on to a cutting board) near by and open the foil

1. Place the asparagus on the grill against the line of the grates (otherwise they will fall between) and grill for a couple minutes until golden brown and slightly charred at the edges

1. Remove from the grill, plate and drizzle with the butter lemon garlic sauce remaining in  the foil, sprinkle with salt and drizzle the rest of the lemon juice on them and serve
