It’s been mango madness over here because both me and my husband love mangoes and we are now at the tail end of mango season. We are super fortunate to have family with a mango tree so when it’s the season there is an abundance. I love to eat them just as they are and I also like to add them to my oats or over yoghurt. When I have a lot of ripe ones at one given time I remove all the pulp from them and freeze them and add them to smoothies. 
This time I wanted to try something a little different with my over abundance of mangos. I saw a great recipe from Eat delicious and I thought I would try it. I wanted to sort of make it my own though, so I just followed some basic principles from Dennis Prescott’s recipe and used my own flavours.

The ginger in the recipe is not at all overpowering and goes well with the mangoes giving them a little extra flavour boost. A touch of ginger goes a long way but if you like a good gingery zing feel free to add more than the recipe calls for. Ginger pairs really well with a lot of things mangoes and limes being just a few. They make a wonderful combo for this galette from top to bottom.

## How to make the perfect galette dough
The dough comes together very quickly and easily in the food processor and grating the butter or cutting it into small pieces makes all the difference even though you are using the food processor. It’s allows the fat to distribute really well and requires a lot less work time. The less you need to work/handle the dough the better and flakier it is. I do it all the time with my scones and also my puff pastry.

## Why add alcohol to pie dough?
There is a actually a legit reason other than having a boozy dough. The original recipe called for vodka and I wanted to know why. I’m not opposed to adding booze to anything but I wanted to know if there was actually a chemical reaction of sorts that takes place by adding it so I did a little research. I learned that there is some science to back up making a boozy galette or pie crust. The alcohol (has to be a hard liquor like vodka, bourbon or Rum) isn’t necessarily to intoxicate the pie but has to do with the gluten. 
</br>
</br>

Liquid is needed for the dough to form into a ball. When liquids are added to the wheat flours, the wheat flour proteins form gluten which can really toughen up the dough. To help prevent this but still allow the fat and flour to bind and make that little dough ball, you add the booze. In their cookbook, The Science of Good Cooking, Cook’s Illustrated explains “…gluten won’t form in alcohol. The ethyl alcohol in vodka and other liquors does not attach itself in the same way as water. Because of this, it does not hydrate the proteins, and therefore does not aid in gluten formation.”

</br>

So there you have it, there’s a good reason to add booze to your dough! For those who are worried about the alcohol instilling too much flavour into the crust - have no fear, you barely notice it’s there. If you still have your concerns than stick to adding the vodka which almost leaves little to no trace after it’s been baked or just replace the alcohol in the recipe with ice cold water. 
</br>
</br>

This recipe is fabulously easy and that is saying a lot coming from me! I’m going to try making more pies and pastries in the near future and I will continue to chose the easiest ways of making them to share with you guys! This is a great no fail recipe for the crust and it’s versatile enough for any fruit filling. Definitely give it a go and let me know what you think of it!

### Ingredients

#### Lime-Rum Crust
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1¼ cups all purpose flour</span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tbsp granulated sugar</span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Zest of 1 lime</span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">¼ tsp of salt</span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 to 4tbsp of chilled Rum (dark or light- alternatively use water) </span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 stick of butter (grated or cut into pieces and chilled)</span>

#### Mango Ginger filling
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">¼ tsp peeled and grated ginger root</span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 cups of mango peeled and sliced (approx 2-3 mangoes)</span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">¼ cup sugar (reduce by half if your mangoes are super ripe and sweet)</span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Zest and juice of 1 lime </span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tsp coconut extract or vanilla extract </span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tsp of all purpose flour for dusting base  of galette</span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 egg whisked for egg wash </span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tbsp brown sugar for sprinkling over galette edges </span>
</br>

### Directions

1.	Combine the flour, sugar, lime zest and salt in a food processor and pulse several times to combine. Add the chilled and grated or cut pieces of butter to the food processor and pulse until the mixture resembles a coarse meal.
2.	With the processor running on low, add 1 tbsp of Rum at a time until the mixture comes together into a dough ball. Turn it out onto a a lightly floured surface and shape it into a flattened disc with your hands. Cover it with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 3 hours or overnight.
3.	Preheat oven to 400 degrees F when ready to make the filling, and line a baking sheet with parchment paper
4.	In a large bowl combine all the filling Ingredients and gently stir to combine.
5.	Sprinkle flour on a your rolling surface along with your rolling pin and get the disc dough out of the fridge and roll it out between two pieces of parchment paper into approx 12 inch round. Once you have it rolled out transfer it onto a baking sheet then peel off the top layer of parchment paper. 
6.	Sprinkle 1 tsp of flour evenly over the middle of the pie dough. Starting with the ripest mangos, spoon them out into the middle of the dough and the more firm pieces you can arrange on top, and spread out leaving 1½ inch border all around.
7.	Fold the edges of the dough as if you are pleating it as you work your way around the whole galette which will hold all that lovely filling in.
8.	Whisk the egg and brush the top of the dough with it and then sprinkle the dough generously with the brown sugar
9.	Bake for approx 30-35 minutes or until the filling is bubbling and the crust is golden brown. It’s totally ok if juice from the filling seeps out a bit onto the parchment paper while it’s baking. Serve warm topped with ice cream or whipped cream or enjoy it on its own.
</br>

### Recipe Notes
* Make Ahead Instructions: The dough can be made ahead of time and chilled in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. The dough can be frozen for up to 3 months after prepared. Allow to thaw overnight in the refrigerator before rolling out and filling.
* Storage: Cover and store leftover galette in the refrigerator for up to 4 days.
* Cold Ingredients: Make sure the butter is SUPER cold. Cold ingredients, as well as chilling, help the crust keep its shape.
* Feel free to leave out the rum in the crust and substitute it for ice cold water.
* Feel free to leave out the lime zest from the crust if you want a more plain crust.
