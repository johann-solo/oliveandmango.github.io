Fall season is definitely upon us. That means apple picking and all the warm spiced baked goods. One of the best parts of going apple picking is getting some warm apple cider doughnuts when you are checking out. I’m pretty sure that is the only reason my hubby comes with me. They smell heavenly - you just can’t resist getting a few to enjoy there and some to take home. They smell like fall to me - so if you are looking for a fall treat and getting into the fall spirit like I am, this is defining the one. All the same flavours of apple cider doughnuts but in a beautiful bundt that is baked (not fried like the doughnuts are) so break out your bundt pans people.

I am happy to be collaborating with <span class="highlight"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://ciroa.com">Ciroa</a></span> to bring you this delicious bundt cake recipe showcasing their beautiful bundt cake decorative pans. I made this recipe in their Scallop Decorative Cake Pan, their Swirl Decorative Cake Pan, their Acorns & Leaves Decorative Cake Pan and their Mini Cake Pan with Pumpkin & Leaves. The pans are a delight to use. They have a great non-stick layer which is helpful for unveiling a perfect bundt every time. I showcased my bundts on their pedestal cake stands with bamboo insert as well.

When it comes to bundts there is no reason to fear those intricate nooks and crannies. Embrace them. These Ciroa pans are great pans but no matter the pan I always love to coat them with my trusty cake pan release paste. This is the <span class="highlight"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.ifyougiveablondeakitchen.com/2016/07/05/grease-cake-pan-release/">one I us</a></span> it’s the simplest one to make. It’s equal parts vegetable shortening, vegetable oil and flour combined to make a paste and I usually make extra this time of year because it stores well for all the other bundts and cakes I will be making.

Of all the fall flavoured bundts you make this fall season make sure and squeeze this simple one in. I have made a few apple cider bundt cake recipes out there but this one is my personal favorite and it’s by _Martha Stewart_. Her recipe is basically a bowl and whisk kind of recipe. Simple, no fuss and can be whipped up in no time. No reducing the apple cider, or anything time consuming like that - just basic ingredients go in to making what is essentially a giant cakey doughnut, made a little more wholesome with whole-wheat flour. The blend of olive oil and applesauce helps keep it moist and there is just enough cinnamon and apple pie spice mix in there to give you all the fall feels. Feel free to top yours with whatever you like. I love sticking to the classic cinnamon sugar but hubby loved the maple cider glaze. A simple dusting of powdered sugar works beautifully too and helps showcase some of the lovely intricate designs on this bundt. You are going to love this cake! Enjoy.

## Recipe
### Ingredients

* <span itemprop="ingredients">2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted, plus more for pan </span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour, plus more for pan</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">1 cup whole-wheat flour</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">1&frac12; teaspoons baking powder </span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">1&frac12; teaspoons ground cinnamon, divided </span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">1 teaspoon apple pie spice *</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">&frac12; teaspoon baking soda </span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">&frac34; teaspoon kosher salt </span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">1&frac34; cups light brown sugar, divided </span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">1 cup apple cider </span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">&frac34; cup olive oil or any other vegetable oil (I often use coconut oil) </span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">&frac34; cup unsweetened applesauce </span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract </span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">3 large eggs, room temperature</span>


__For the Maple-Cider Glaze__

* <span itemprop="ingredients">1 cup powdered sugar</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">1 tablespoon maple syrup or honey</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">1 tablespoon apple cider</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">½ teaspoon ground ginger</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">½ teaspoon cinnamon</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">½ teaspoon vanilla extract</span>


### Directions

1. Preheat oven to 350°F. Butter and flour a bundt pan (10-12 cup). 
2. In a large bowl, whisk together the dry ingredients both flours, baking powder, 1 teaspoon cinnamon, apple pie spice, baking soda, and salt. 
3. In another bowl, whisk together 1&frac12; cups sugar, cider, oil, applesauce, vanilla, and eggs. Add egg mixture to flour mixture; whisk until combined. Transfer batter to prepared pan. 
4. Bake, rotating pan halfway through, until a tester inserted in center comes out clean, 45 to 50 minutes. Transfer pan to a wire rack set over a rimmed baking sheet for less mess when glazing or sprinkling with sugar; let cool 15 minutes. Meanwhile, mix together remaining &frac14; cup sugar and &frac12; teaspoon cinnamon. 
5. Invert warm cake onto rack. Brush with melted butter, then sprinkle liberally with cinnamon sugar. Let cool completely before serving. Cake can be stored, covered, at room temperature up to 2 days. If glazing or dusting with powdered sugar allow cake to cool completely before doing so. 

__For the glaze version__

* Combine all ingredients in a small bowl and whisk until smooth. Drizzle over cooled cake.

### Recipe Notes
&ast; 
If premixed Apple pie spice blend is not available where you are here is a simple mix you can [make on your own](https://www.bhg.com/recipes/how-to/bake/how-to-make-apple-pie-spice/)
</br>
</br>

Bundt pans need to be generously buttered and floured so cakes don't stick; use a pastry brush to be sure to get into all the crevices. I love to use a cake pan release paste as noted on the blog post.
