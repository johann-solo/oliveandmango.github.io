This hearty saucy chickpea, chicken and tomato dish is loaded with warming spices. It’s so quick to make using the Instant pot or pressure cooker if you have one but worth the extra time if you decide to braise this stovetop or in the oven. Instructions for both included.

Not only is it loaded with flavour but it also has a good amount of greens added to it. It’s made of basic pantry tin ingredients like chickpeas and canned crushed tomatoes along with spices you may already have in your pantry with the exception of a few like the garam masala. Traditional garam masala is an incredibly complex spice blend that often contains more than 30 ingredients. A store bought blend is a great and easy way to go but if you can’t locate one you can substitute curry powder for a similar warmth but not the exact flavour, or a mixture of allspice and cumin.

Authentic chana masala is typically made with whole spices, plus some dried mango powder (amchur). Mango powder isn’t a very simple spice for everyone to find that adds a sour tang to recipes, so that is why it’s often replaced with lemon juice/vinegar in recipes just like this one. It’s a tangy spice made from green mangos that have been dried and powdered. This is not as authentic, as we are using ground spices. Cooking them off in butter to bring out their best flavour. It’s a simplified version that is super tasty and does not disappoint.

### Directions

1. Heat butter in a pressure cooker over medium-high heat (sauté setting on instant pot). Add onions, garlic, chilis and ginger. Cook, stirring frequently, until onions are translucent and just starting to get some golden colour on them - approximately 5 minutes. 
2. Add cumin, coriander, turmeric, and chili pepper stirring frequently, until aromatic, about 30 seconds. Add crushed tomatoes and spinach and cook, stirring occasionally, until spinach is wilted, just a few minutes and scrape the bottom of the pot well to release all the brown bits. 
3. Add half of cilantro, chicken stock, and chicken pieces. Stir to combine. Seal instant pot/pressure cooker and heat to high pressure  and program to cook for 15 minutes with quick release.**
4. Remove lid and stir in drained chickpeas, 1 tablespoons lemon juice, and simmer (you may need to turn the Instant pot back on to sauté setting for a quick simmer), stirring frequently, until sauce is slightly reduced and thickened, just a few minutes. Season to taste with salt. Remove from heat and stir in the cream and Garam masala. Serve immediately, garnished with remaining cilantro leaves.

* Note: if you decide to brown your chicken before sweating the onions and chili’s that is fine just adjust the timing to 12 minutes instead of 15 as the chicken will cook through a little, while browning.
