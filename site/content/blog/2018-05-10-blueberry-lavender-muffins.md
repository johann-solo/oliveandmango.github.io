excerpt: Muffins bursting with blueberry flavour with lovely notes of lavender
---

Each bite of these muffins is a joy! There’s a blueberry bursting in every bite. The sweet buttery and crumbling topping adds another layer of texture to each bite along with the perfectly moist and balanced amount of crumble. This is paired with the subtle scent and flavour of lavender which hits the tastebuds and the nostrils all at the same time.

Let’s talk lavender. Fresh or dried, lavender is one of those scents that is soothing and so wonderful. Using fresh lavender to infuse the sugar would be wonderful but we don’t have fresh lavender here so I used dried and it worked great to infuse that beautiful scent to the muffins. It lends well to the flavour of these muffins. I love warm spices and scents like this lavender with anything blueberry. The two seem to pair very well and the lavender always tends to bring out the fruity taste in berries in general and also brings out the sweetness in them. I love it but if you aren’t a fan then just omit it, but it is worth tying it. It’s subtle and very delicate. If you ARE a fan of lavender and think the infusion is too subtle feel free to add a little more. I wouldn’t add more than an extra &frac14; tsp though because adding too much can impart some bitterness, so just a caution.

I’m actually quite shocked that this is my first blueberry muffin recipe on the blog. Shame on me. I do have other delicious blueberry baked goods on it but not muffins. Blueberry muffins are by far my favourite. If there’s ever a choice of what kind of muffin I want, it will always be blueberry. I never tire of it and I love to taste different ones and versions from different places. You know I always have a bit of a good story about my food experiences, so let me tell you how the love of blueberry muffins started.

There’s a little coffee shop in Canada called _Tim Horton’s_. You may or may not have heard of it. Ha ha! Anyways that is where it all began. I use to car pool with a girl I worked with. I hated it! She was nice enough but she usually ran late and made me late and she would talk about her cat non-stop. I love animals and all but I didn’t want to hear about them at 6:45 in the morning right through for an hour of our drive to work. Anyways she was a Chatty Cathy. She also needed to stop at Tim Hortons for her usual large steeped tea with milk and a blueberry muffin every morning. That is the part that usually made us late. There was always a crazy line up. Anyways this always used to annoy me because I usually had breakfast at home or would bring it along. Eventually she got me hooked though and I started with the large steeped tea, milk only, and a blueberry muffin. It was almost ritualistic and over the years it became our thing. The habit was formed and also the addiction to those blueberry muffins.

These are definitely better than those muffins. They might not be super sized like the ones at Tim Hortons but they are delicious. I worked along with _Smitten Kitchen's_ recipe for her perfect blueberry muffins which is a great recipe. Her recipe calls for 9 muffins but I usually get 10. It just depends how you spread the batter out. The more you spread it, the smaller the muffins obviously. I wanted a little more texture than just the sugar topping in her recipe so I used this crumble topping and of course I jazzed them up with the lavender.

They are perfect and I can’t resist them out of the oven. If their are leftovers the next day I will heat them in the oven and they are fab with a bit of butter. Overall a great recipe that I always make when I have a hankering for blueberry muffins and want to reminisce about my drives to work with Chatty Cathy. No for real though, I haven’t thought about all of that until I started thinking back to when I started loving these muffins and now I’m wondering how Jennifer is. Always fun to think about all the memories attached to foods. Hope you give these a try, I think you will love them with or without the lavender and with or without the crumble, although I recommend adding both!

### Ingredients
Makes approximately 10 muffins
</br>
</br>

__For the muffins__

* 5 tablespoons unsalted butter, cold is fine
* &frac12; cup sugar
* &frac12; teaspoon dried lavender buds
* Finely grated zest from &frac12; a lemon
* &frac34; cup plain unsweetened yogurt or sour cream
* 1 large egg
* 1 &frac12; teaspoons baking powder
* &frac14; teaspoon baking soda
* &frac14; teaspoon fine sea or table salt
* 1 &frac12; cups all-purpose flour
* 1 &frac14; to 1 &frac12; cups blueberries, fresh or frozen (no need to defrost if frozen)
&frac14; cup of flour to dust the frozen blueberries with before folding them into the batter (if using frozen only)


__For the crumb topping__

* &frac12; cup all-purpose flour
* 1 &frac12; tablespoons light brown sugar
* 1 tablespoons granulated sugar
* &frac12; teaspoon baking powder
* Pinch of salt
* 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted

### Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 375&deg;F. Line 9 muffin cups with paper or foil liners or spray 2 muffin tins with cooking spray.

1. In a medium bowl, combine the crumb topping ingredients - flour with the brown sugar, granulated sugar, baking powder and salt. Stir in the melted butter, then pinch the mixture until it forms pea-size clumps and set aside. Add more flour if needed to achieve a crumb texture and then set aside. 

1. On a cutting board chop up the dried lavender. Add this to the sugar, and use your clean and dry hands to work the lavender into the sugar massaging it into the sugar to infuse it and break down the lavender further.

1. Melt butter in a large bowl and whisk in the sugar, lavender mixture, lemon zest, yogurt and egg until smooth.

1. Then whisk in baking powder, baking soda and salt until fully combined

1. If using frozen berries, lightly dust or toss them in some all purpose flour which will help prevent them from sinking to the bottom of the pan, and then gently fold the flour and the berries into the batter. Batter will be very thick, like a cookie dough.

1. Divide between prepared muffin cups and sprinkle each generously with crumb topping.

1. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, until tops are golden and a tester inserted into the center of muffins comes out. Remove and let cool in pan for 10 minutes then the rest of the way on a cooling rack.
