excerpt: Flourless, naturally sweetened and fabulous
---

I saw Tieghan’s (_Half Baked Harvest_) recipe for these using peanut butter and I knew exactly what had to be done. I needed to make an almond butter version. So glad I did too. These are the perfect snack. We couldn’t get enough! My husband was a little suspect about them, but one after the other they were gone in no time. They have a very nice and chewy texture and the chocolate drizzle and extra nuts add even more texture and a bit of crunch.

I stuck pretty close to the original recipe. I just added some almond meal. I thought it would add a bit more texture to the cookies and I was happy with the outcome and glad that I added it to them. They may feel a little on the oily side when you are rolling them but have no fear they bake up perfect.

We stored ours in the freezer in a sealed container because I made these in Trinidad and if left out of the fridge, the chocolate would become a very gooey mess. They would do just fine in the fridge as well if you actually have any leftover to store. They go pretty quickly.

Not only are they fabulous but they are fully made in the food processor and take under 30 minutes to make from start to finish. Simple to whip up and you will be making a second batch immediately after so don’t bother washing out the food processor after your first batch or just plan to make two batches right off the bat. Enjoy!

### Ingredients

* 1 cup almond butter
* 1 cup of pitted dates
* &frac14; cup of almond meal (optional but recommended)
* 1 tsp vanilla extract
* 1 tsp almond extract (sub with vanilla otherwise)
* 1 egg
* 10 oz melted dark chocolate
* Toasted chopped almonds to garnish with and some sea salt

### Directions


1. Preheat the oven to 350&deg;F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside. 
2. Combine the almond butter, dates, and extracts in a food processor and pulse until well combined and no large chunks of dates remain.
3. Add the egg and almond meal and pulse to combine.
4. Roll the dough into balls and place on the baking sheet (I use a cookie scoop to keep the cookies the same size). Makes 12 -15 depending on size. 
5. Gently press down on each dough ball with a fork to flatten and create a cross hatch pattern.
6. Bake for 9-10 minutes and then remove and place the baking sheet on a cooling rack
and allow them to cool. 
7. Once cool transfer them to the freezer for 10-15 minutes while you melt the chocolate and toast your almonds. Freezing them for a few minutes makes it easier to dip them into the chocolate.
8. While the cookies are cooling it’s time to melt the chocolate. In a microwave safe bowl, melt the chocolate in 30 second increments until completely melted. Drizzle or dip each cookie in chocolate and sprinkle with almonds.
9. Allow them to fully set in the refrigerator or eat immediately. They can be stored in an air tight container for up to 4 days.
