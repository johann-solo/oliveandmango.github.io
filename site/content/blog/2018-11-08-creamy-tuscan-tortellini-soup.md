This luscious brothy soup is full of hearty ingredients and is sure to fill your belly and warm your soul. I absolutely love a soup like this that’s full of flavour but doesn’t require hours of simmering. It’s easily done in under 30 minutes – that is the beauty of tortellini. This is such a great midweek option as it cooks up so quickly and can be prepared in so many ways and with so many sauces. Tortellini also comes in a gluten free form which is great for those who have sensitivities. They are a total life saver on busy days when you just don’t have the time to invent a meal. We always have a pack in the freezer just for days like that.

This is one of those meals that saves the day. It doesn’t requires extraordinary ingredients - mostly pantry ingredients and as I said before, it can be whipped up in no time. It’s filling and the flavourful broth is just the kind of comfort you need on a cold evening.

The broth gets its flavour from the sausage and of course the other fresh and dried aromatics. The beans and tortellini give the soup body and make it reminiscent of a minestrone. The added greens give it extra colour and that extra boost in greens that we all need. We loved it served with an extra drizzle of olive oil plus a sprinkling of extra Parmesan cheese and fresh basil.

It’s a great soup that my family requested be on rotation which is fine by me. Love it when they request simple and quick meals! If you are a fan of warm bowls of comfort like we are then this soup is for you! Enjoy!
