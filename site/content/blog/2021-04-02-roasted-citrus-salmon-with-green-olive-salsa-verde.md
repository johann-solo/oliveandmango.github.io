Citrus-infused flaky buttery salmon is easier to make than you think. The salmon falls apart the moment you cut into it, and it pairs perfectly with the citrusy herby briny green olive salsa verde. It makes for a no fuss dinner option for a healthy weeknight dinner and it’s also a tasty and an impressive way to serve dinner to friends and family.

Salmon is one of my favorite dishes to make and there are several ways I like to make it. This is one of them. I use to always think that broiling salmon for a short period of time is  just the best way to have it. I still think it’s a delicious method but it also leaves very little room for error when it comes to cooking time. You have to get it just right or it will easily over cook in minutes leaving you with dry salmon. This recipe has a lot more room for error; since the cooking temperature is so low, if the salmon gets left in the oven for a few extra minutes, no worries. It’s quite forgiving.

Some recipes call for loads of olive oil for the salmon to cook in - you know I love olive oil and I don’t shy away from using plenty of it but I found that my salmon filet did just fine cooking with only 2-3 tablespoons of it. If you think yours might need more please adjust the amount accordingly. I saved most of my olive oil for the salsa verde which is the absolute perfect way to finish this salmon. I got this recipe from Bon Appetit and loved the salsa verde in the recipe but I wanted to add some brininess and heat to it so I added chopped green olives and chili flakes to mine as well. It’s just the simplest most delicious way to enjoy salmon. I chose not to roast my salmon with sliced oranges or lemons this time because I think the zest adds enough flavour without that bitter taste the pith sometimes adds to a dish when full slices are roasted along with it. If you want to add some fresh sliced oranges or lemons to be nestled under or over the salmon feel free too.

Ok let’s talk salsa verde. The first thing that might pop into your head is the green salsa in a jar you eat with tortillas. That is just one of a several variations of what is considered a salsa verde or green sauce that is usually made and served raw and uncooked and served room temp or cold. Some of the most well known ones being tomatillo salsa, chermoula, sauce verte, Chimichurri, pesto, green goddess sauce, and avocado salsa just to name a few.  Almost every country has its own favorite green sauce. Most of them are usually made with five ingredients or less—garlic, fresh herbs, oil, vinegar or some sort of acid and sometimes some form of heat like chiles or chili flakes. They work really well as a marinades or finishing sauces (as I have used it in this recipe) for virtually any meat or vegetable. I love them over roasted or grilled veggies. They can also be considered a dip, spread, sauce or condiment.

### Directions
1. Preheat oven to 250°F. Combine shallot, half of orange zest, half of lemon zest, and 2-3 Tbsps oil in a small baking dish just large enough to fit salmon. Season salmon with salt and coat with zest and oil mixture. Roast fish until fillet is just opaque in the center and flakes with a fork, 30–35 minutes. Will vary by a few minutes  depending on oven and also weight and size of  salmon. 
2. While the salmon is roasting prepare the olive salsa verde. In a medium bowl stir together the  cilantro, parsley, garlic, paprika, remaining zests, chopped olives, ½ cup oil and citrus juices in a medium bowl. Season with salt to taste just before spooning over fish.

### Recipe Notes
* If you want your salmon with a little extra colour around the edges feel free to broil it for the last two minutes of cooking. Not much longer than that so that your salmon doesn’t over cook. 
* Feel free to cook your salmon with thinly sliced orange slices or lemon ones nestled underneath it or over top of it for extra citrus flavour.
