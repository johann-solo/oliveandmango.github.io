excerpt: A simple 4 ingredient nice cream that makes a perfect snack
---

This super simple 4 ingredient nice cream is one of my favorite things to make and snack on. Nice cream is very creamy like traditional ice cream but made by using frozen bananas. It’s obviously dairy free and naturally plant based and vegan. It’s also naturally sweetened from the ripened bananas as well as the other fruits involved in making it.

Recently I received as a gift several maple syrups to try from Runamok maple and came up with some very simple smoothie recipes with their wonderful infused maple syrups. Their syrups are fantastic and they are not flavoured syrups, they are truly infused syrups. That meaning the flavours are intense and wonderful and use actual ingredients to infuse not essences. I made a [green smoothie](https://www.oliveandmango.com/pineapple-citrus-ginger-green-smoothie/) that I shared recently using their ginger infused maple syrup and it was wonderful.

I decided to incorporate the cardamom infused maple syrup into my nice cream.  I am a huge blueberry lover and enjoy adding them to my smoothies and love snacking on them frozen also especially on super hot days. They make the best snack. I love the flavours that cardamom adds to many fruit dishes, jams and pies and I thought it would elevate the flavours in my blueberry nice cream and I was not wrong. It’s subtle but it brings out the sweetness of the berries and complements and even intensifies the blueberry flavour in the nice cream.

I have to say their cardamom infused syrup is one of my favorites. I loved using it in this nice cream but I love it in my regular smoothies and also in my morning coffee. It’s such a warm spice and I love what it adds to whatever you add it in.

Back to the nice cream though. I usually enjoy a scoop of it for brekkie or as a snack with a side of granola, a dollop of PB and whatever other add in I want like nuts and shredded coconut. It’s the perfect cool treat to enjoy on its own as well. And I’m usually making frequent trips to the freezer with my spoon in hand when I know there’s a batch in there. You don’t have to feel guilty when you go back for more and you can literally sit and eat the whole container of it and not need to shed a tear unlike dairy-full ice-cream. Give it a try and definitely add a dash of flavour with the cardamom!
