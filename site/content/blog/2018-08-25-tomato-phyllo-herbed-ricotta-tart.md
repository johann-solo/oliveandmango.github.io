excerpt: A perfectly delicious way to showcase all your plum tomatoes
---

Tomatoe season has just been so amazing this year. We have been having juicy succulent tomato based salads every day and lots of cheese and tomato or tomato and aioli sandwiches! I can’t get enough! As much as I love roasted tomatoes and sauces, for me nothing beats them uncooked and freshly picked from garden. Sweet and tart and juicy and totally perfect.

This is the 4th tomato recipe that has been on repeat for us this season and I have one more coming. We always have a good old [horiatiki salad](https://www.oliveandmango.com/classic-greek-village-salad-horiatiki/) on repeat in our house, nothing screams summer louder than a light and [delicious gazpacho](https://www.oliveandmango.com/creamy-delicious-simple-and-classic-gazpacho/), and my husband especially can’t get enough of this [salad](https://www.oliveandmango.com/easy-chickpea-caprese-salad/). This tart is the perfect addition to all these yummy tomato rich recipes.

This is one of my favorite summer appetizers! It doesn’t require a lot of effort to make and only minutes in the oven. It’s great for a crowd and hits all the flavour marks too. Creamy, crispy and juicy all in one bite.

It’s not only simple to make and delicious but it also pretty easy on the eyes. It’s a stunning way to showcase all the gorgeous tomatoes. I had a few garden heirloom tomatoes given to me and thought his way would be the best to really showcase them and more importantly enjoy them! They were so plum and delicious - and perfect for this tart.

Ricotta and tomatoes are so wonderful together but ricotta is pretty much a good match to many things - sweet and savoury. The original recipe called for a cream cheese and mayo based creamy layer but I went with the ricotta because ricotta is creamy and delicious but also mellow enough to allow the tomatoes to rule in this recipe. This would also be wonderful with my [whipped feta](https://www.oliveandmango.com/zucchini-tart-with-whipped-feta-and-chives/) as the base as well. You will love it and goes very well with some wine and good company! Hope you enjoy!

## Recipe
Serves 8-10
</br>
</br>

### Ingredients

__For the creamy herbed ricotta__

* 2 cups ricotta
* ¼ cup heavy cream
* &frac12; of a small Lemon juiced 
* 1 tbsp of finely chopped parsley
* 1 tbsp of finely chopped basil
* 1 tbsp of finely chopped chives
* Salt and pepper to taste

__For the phyllo__

* 6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling
* 1 clove of garlic finely minced
* 8 sheets of phyllo dough, thawed
* &frac12; cup fine dry breadcrumbs
* 1&frac12; pounds mixed heirloom tomatoes, thinly sliced
* Salt and Pepper to taste
* Basil leaves, for garnish

### Directions 

1. Preheat the oven to 375 &deg; F
1. In a medium size bowl whisk together the ricotta, cream, lemon juice, herbs, salt and pepper until creamy and combined and set aside. Can be made ahead up to a day before and stored in a sealed container in the fridge.
2. In a small bowl combine the garlic with the olive oil.
3. Brush a large rimmed baking sheet with 2 teaspoons of the olive oil. (Feel free to line it with parchment paper to easily transfer it to another dish if preferred). 
4. Lay 1 sheet of the phyllo dough on the baking sheet; keep the rest covered with damp paper towels. 
5. Brush the phyllo with 2 teaspoons of the olive oil and sprinkle all over with 1 tablespoon of the breadcrumbs. Repeat the layering with the remaining phyllo, olive oil and breadcrumbs. 
6. Bake the crust for about 20-25 minutes, until golden and crisp (keep a close eye on it after the 20 minute mark as it can over cook easily); rotating the baking sheet halfway through cooking. Let cool completely.
7. Spread the ricotta mixture in the center of the tart, leaving a &frac12; inch border all around. 
8. Arrange the tomato slices on top and sprinkle with flaky sea salt and pepper. 
9. Drizzle lightly with olive oil and garnish with basil leaves. 
10. Cut into squares and serve immediately and enjoy.
