This simple and super quick one pan meal has just the right amount of heat and loads of flavour. Drunken noodles or Pad Kee Moa is a popular street food dish in Thailand and also a popular dish in North American Thai restaurants as well. There are so many variations of Drunken Noodles both in Thailand and here. In Thailand the two constants in the region are chicken and Thai Basil, and many times it comes with baby corn as well.

The original version is super spicy but making it at home allows your to control the amount of heat you want to add to the dish. This version is just as delicious as any other but a little less authentic when it comes to some of the ingredients. I swapped the chicken for <span class="highlight"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://oceans.ca/products/thai-chili-yellowfin-tuna-steaks/">Ocean’s Thai Chili Yellowfin Tuna Steaks</a></span>. It made sense as they are perfectly marinated with Thai seasoning.  I have seen other versions that use ground chicken or ground pork as the protein so you can see how versatile this recipe can be.

Drunken noodles take no time to make especially after the protein is cooked. That is another reason I decided to use these tuna steaks in this recipe. Not only are they delicious from the tasty marinade they come in (literally do not need to add a thing to them) but they are so quick and easy to prepare.

In less than ten minutes your steaks are done. They come frozen and can be cooked from frozen but I thawed mine over night in the refrigerator which made them even quicker to cook. The tuna is a great protein addition to this noodle dish - each steak gives you approximately 27g of delicious protein. And this particular brand of tuna ensures that all their tuna products are responsibly caught. All in all it’s a great tuna steak and you can see why I chose to use it with these noodles.
