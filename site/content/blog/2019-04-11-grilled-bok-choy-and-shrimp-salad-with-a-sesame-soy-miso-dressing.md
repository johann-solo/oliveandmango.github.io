Grilling season is all year round for my family.  No matter the weather the grill is on either outside or inside via the grill pan. I especially enjoy grilling in the summer months. Nothing says summer like the smell of grill smoke in the air, cold drink in hand enjoying late sunsets outdoors. The beauty of grilling - indoor or outdoor is how quick and easy a meal can be put together.

I was happy to partner up with Metro to bring you a quick and delicious shrimp recipe from their Irresistible brand Pacific White frozen Shrimp. Not only is Metro a convenient place for me to shop, it’s a place where I always find what I’m looking for. Frozen shrimp is a great thing to have on hand in your freezer because they are quick to thaw and wonderful for whipping up a quick appetizer, great in a quick pasta dish and totally delicious on the grill. These shrimp literally take no time to grill along with the Bok Choy and are so delicious and full of flavour.  We served them with a side of rice that cooked up while I grilled everything but they are also great with some garlic chili noodles if you wanted to get more creative than rice, or even in fresh rolls. It’s also a great salad on its own as a light lunch or dinner.

I got the idea for the wedge salad from the LCBO spring issue. It had a feature of all sorts of wedge salads that you can make and enjoy this spring/summer season. This wasn’t one of them but I thought of making it when I saw a delicious sesame miso tahini dressing. That’s where the inspiration came from for this recipe. Instead of using tahini in the dressing and marinade, I decided to use miso paste as I love it and the flavours are perfect together. I decided to use shrimp as they grill so quickly and one of my favorite greens to have with a garlicky sesame- soy dressing is Bok Choy. I love stir frying them on the regular and thought they would be perfect grilled. Well I was right y’all. It was a fantastic combo. The dressing is fantastic. Loaded with lots of flavour from the miso, garlic and ginger and of course the sesame oil and soy sauce. Not only do you dress your salad with it after it’s all grilled but the dressing actually doubles as the marinade for the shrimp or at least part of it is reserved for that very purpose. The dressing gets brushed on to the Bok Choy just before  they hit the grill while the shrimp marinate in some of the dressing.

I thought that a little colour and extra crunch and sweetness was needed and so I added the grilled sweet red pepper to this salad and it was a great addition.  Feel free to add some grilled mushrooms and even some grilled scallions to it.  It’s a versatile recipe when it comes to the veggies that you might like to add. We always inhale this and I know that when I make it for company I always need to double the recipe. The perfect finish to it is some toasted sesame seeds sprinkled over top, sliced scallions and of course extra drizzles of this delicious dressing. Hope you add this delicious grilled salad to your grilling favorites!

* <span itemprop="ingredients">&frac14; (60ml) unseasoned rice vinegar </span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">2 tbsp (30ml) soy sauce</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">2 tbsp (30ml) white miso paste </span>

* <span itemprop="ingredients">&frac13; tsp of chopped/grated garlic</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">Hot pepper sauce like sriracha to taste (optional) </span>

### Directions

1. For the dressing, whisk together the canola or soy bean oil, vinegar, soy sauce, miso paste, honey, sesame oil, garlic and ginger in small bowl until well combined. Season to taste with hot pepper sauce. Use immediately or cover and refrigerate for up to 1 week. 
2. For the salad, preheat barbecue grill to medium-high (or set grill pan over medium/high heat on the stove top if grilling indoors) Heat a grilling basket or grilling sheet for shrimp. 
3. Trim stems from bok choy if needed and peel off loose outer leaves, cut heads vertically in half and brush all over with the dressing. Brush the chuncks of red pepper with the dressing as well.
4. Toss shrimp with 1-2 tbsp of the dressing in a bowl and set aside. 
5. Grill bok choy wedges and sweet red pepper chunks turning to cook all sides, for about 3-5 minutes or until grill-marked and tender. 
6. Grill shrimp in basket or on sheet, turning once, for about 2 minutes or until just pink and opaque. Transfer to separate plates. 
7. To assemble, arrange bok choy wedges and red pepper chunks on a large platter or on each serving plate. Top with shrimp, and drizzle with the dressing to taste. Sprinkle over some toasted sesame seeds, chopped scallions, chopped fresh cilantro and serve immediately with some lemon wedges.

### Recipe Tip
If you don’t have a grilling basket or sheet which helps prevent shrimp from sticking or falling through the grill - feel free to thread the shrimp onto soaked skewers and grease grill well before grilling them.
