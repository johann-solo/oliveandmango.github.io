I first came across this recipe when I was checking out some of the hotels on surrounding islands. I was actually checking out not just the hotels but some of the best restaurants on these islands as well.  I was intrigued by one in St Lucia which featured a lot of cocoa based food and came across this amazing mashed potato recipe using cocoa butter in it.

The cocoa butter gives it the most unique and I would say earthy and even nutty flavour, not to mention the loveliest creamiest velvety texture! They are so decadent and delicious. I would have never thought to make mashed potatoes out of it and am so glad I came across that restaurant on-line.  One day I will get to visit it myself. In the meantime this mashed potatoes recipe is a special one I will be keeping and remaking possibly with some kind of rich brazed meat in a dark cocoa sauce.  Wouldn’t that be amazing!

I had to tweak the recipe that is on their website because when it came down to making it the potato, milk and butter ratio along with the amount of cocoa butter didn’t add up to me. I used more potatoes, less cocoa butter and less butter.  The milk stayed the same.

When it comes to making them I advise adding all the cocoa butter first and then tasting to see if you want a more intense cocoa butter flavour. If you do feel free to add a little more. In the instructions I say to add half the butter first. That is because depending on the size of potatoes - you may not need to add the full amount.  I guess that is why it’s easiest to go by weight when writing recipes up. Although that way is more accurate, it’s not as convenient because not everybody has a food scale at home.  So just gauge the butter amount and add as much as you need to get the creamy texture you desire.

The same goes for the milk.  I like to add half of it first and then gradually keep adding drizzles of it as I mix. It wasn’t the easiest to locate cocoa butter here.  The friends at cocoa bel came through with some from Ranch Quemado cocoa estate though. That estate is where you can buy some if you need some. We have some of the best cocoa in the world and so naturally our cocoa butter is first class rating too. Smooth buttery and of the highest quality. I was so happy I got my hands on the good stuff.

The cocoa butter elevates the mashed potatoes to something pretty extraordinary. Apparently it’s one of the most popular dishes to order at this restaurant. Well now you don’t have to wait to go to St Lucia to try it.  You can try it right at home accompanying all your other dishes. Make them while you enjoy a tropical cocktail and it will feel like your practically there. These were a delightful change to a typical side and we loved them. The hotel I am talking about is Hotel Chocolat in St Lucia by the way. Enjoy!!

### Ingredients

1. 6-8 medium potatoes peeled and chopped into large cubes
1. &frac34; stick of butter cut and divided (substitute with vegan butter)
1. 2&frac12; oz of cocoa butter chopped – or unsweetened white chocolate (made from pure cocoa butter, not the partially hydrogenated type)
1. &frac12; cup of full fat milk (nut milk or non dairy milk can be subbed to make them vegan)
1. Salt and pepper to taste
1. Chopped chives to top
<br>

### Directions

1. Place your potatoes in a large pot and fill with cold water covering them with at least a couple inches of water.

1. Bring them to a boil and salt the water generously. Then reduce to a fast simmer for approx 10-15 minutes or until soft when pierced with a fork.  

1. Turn the heat off. Drain the potatoes in a colander and then put them back In the pot.

1. Add the cocoa butter and half of the butter and stir until they both are melted. Add a little more butter as needed to get a nice consistency. I usually add it all depending on the size of the potatoes.  

1. Use an electric mixer at medium-low speed or a hand masher to mash the potatoes slightly right in the pot. Pour in the milk and continue mixing until creamy, about 1 minute. Do not over mix.

1. Season with salt and pepper and serve while they are hot.
