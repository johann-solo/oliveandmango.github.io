description: A simple recipe for super moist and delicious chocolate zucchini bread.

With the exception of my [banana bread](https://www.oliveandmango.com/no-fail-banana-bread/), this zucchini one has been the most requested by you guys and of course my family. It blew up on instagram and I was sorry I didn’t have the post ready sooner than when I posted the teaser picture of it. There is no question why this is so popular. It’s fabulously moist from the fresh zucchini baked right into it and so rich and chocolatey from the cocoa and the chocolate chunks.

I have made this so many time since I first shared it on Instagram and the result is always the same - perfection! I adapted the recipe from The Kitchn and it’s a wonderful one. I usually double the amount and make a larger loaf as you see here in one of my larger tins, so feel free to do that if you want, otherwise it’s great in a regular 9x5 loaf pan.

We have shared this one with so many and the response is always the same. It’s loved across the board and everyone always wants the recipe so I am very very excited to share it! This summer has been so busy that I’m a bit back logged with my blog posts. It’s a good problem to have and I’m totally not complaining but I apologize for those of you patiently waiting for this and others. I promise all of them will be up soon. Back to it being a hit with everyone...

The only thing that a few people mentioned is that they would reduce the amount of chocolate chunks. I love chocolate chunks in my bread and if you love them too I wouldn’t change a thing, but if you don’t like them, reduce the amount or leave them out completely. Have no worries the bread is just as fabulous without them. It stands alone well even without the chocolate chunks or chips but I’m all about the chocolate so I love to add them and I even add a few extra on the top for a decorative touch plus for extra chocolatey goodness.

Some may say I went a little too far when I added the chocolate ganache but if you are a chocolate lover like I am you won’t regret it. I included the recipe below for a simple ganache that I use to drizzle on many things along with this zucchini bread. It’s totally optional but there if you want to add it and amp up the decadence of this bread.

It’s absolutely delicious and we love it to snack on but even more for breakfast. My husband loves to toast his slice and eat it lightly buttered. I love it in the afternoon with my tea. It’s just the right amount of chocolate. It’s also not overly sweet and that is why I excuse it for breakfast too. The things we try and justify - I tell ya!!

You most definitely need to add this to your list of things to make with all the zucchini in your garden or your friends garden or the plethora still at the market and grocery store. I have two other things you must make with all your zucchini as well. These fabulous [zucchini fritters](https://www.oliveandmango.com/zucchini-fritters/) and you must absolutely make this [zucchini tart with whipped feta and chives](https://www.oliveandmango.com/zucchini-tart-with-whipped-feta-and-chives/). Have fun making all the delicious things with zucchini including this bread! I know you will love it!

## Recipe
</br>

* &frac14; teaspoon sea salt
* &frac12; cup coconut oil
* &frac12; cup granulated sugar
* &frac12; cup light brown sugar
* 2 large eggs
* 1 teaspoon instant coffee powder or &frac12; teaspoon espresso powder (optional but recommended to accentuate that cocoa flavour)
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* &frac12; to &frac34; cup chocolate chunks or chips, optional and if you are a nut fan - feel free to do half chocolate chucks and half chopped pecans or walnuts.

### Directions

1. Preheat oven to 350 &deg; F and spray a 9-by-5 inch loaf pan with nonstick cooking spray or line with overhanging pieces of parchment paper
2. In a medium bowl, whisk the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder and salt, and set aside.
3. In a large bowl, using a hand mixer, beat the oil, sugars, eggs, instant coffee, and the vanilla until blended, about 2 minutes.
4. Whisk the shredded zucchini into the dry ingredients and then add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients in two batches, mixing between each addition. 
5. Stir in chocolate chucks or chips.
6. Spoon batter into the loaf pan and smooth the top. Bake 55 to 65 minutes, or until a knife or toothpick inserted into the center of the bread comes out clean.
7. When the bread is done, cool in the pan on a wire rack for 10 minutes. Turn out the loaf onto the rack to finish cooling.

__Make ahead tip__: The bread can be wrapped and frozen for up to 3 months. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator and allow to come to room temperature before serving.
