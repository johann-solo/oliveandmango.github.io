Peach and nectarine season cannot pass me by without making my very favourite thing to make with any fruit - crumbles, crisps and cobblers, easier than pie and thrown together in minutes. With little effort you are left with deliciously sweet and tender peaches and nectarines under a blanket of crunchy pecan crumble.

This is a riff on a recipe by _Smitten Kitchen_. I love all of her recipes and her crisp and crumble recipes are just the way I like them. They are not overly sweet which I love because the fruit is usually sweet enough and we want the star of the crisp or crumble to be the fruit not the sugar. Speaking of sugar - this crumble actually has none. It’s naturally sweetened with either honey or maple syrup depending on whether you want it to be vegan or not. Extra sweetness and texture is added to the crumble topping via the chopped dates in it. You read that right - there are dates in the topping and you will just have to trust me on that. I got inspired to add them to my crumble from a recipe by _Green Kitchen Stories_. They do what sugar and butter do (take that butter and sugar! - they do have their place just not in this recipe). They sweeten the topping plus when rubbed together with the dry ingredients of the topping, help clump or bind pieces together so the topping is part crumble part sandy.

Let’s talk more about that topping. I partnered up with _GoGo Quinoa_ for this recipe and decided I would use a blend of their <span class="highlight"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.gogoquinoa.com/products/buckwheat-flakes/">Buckwheat flakes</a></span> </span> and <span class="highlight"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.gogoquinoa.com/products/quinoa-flakes-pre-cooked/">Quinoa flakes</a></span> to make it. Their flakes are quite fine in texture and I love making porridge out of them and thought the blend would make the perfect texture for this sandy topping. Another feature that makes this topping absolutely delicious is the pecans, which must be lightly toasted to emphasize the pecan flavour. I also process most of them so that they are very fine and flour-like, infusing the whole topping with that beautiful nutty flavour. The rest of the pecans get a rough chop and add a little crunch to the topping too.

The fruit gets tossed with a bit of cornstarch or tapioca flour along with some freshly squeezed lemon juice and just a bit of maple syrup or honey, some vanilla and some warm spices. That’s all they need and then they are ready for the topping and to be baked off. Once golden and bubbly this crumble is ready to be served with a scoop of icecream or a dollop of yoghurt. Good enough for dessert and can easily pass for breakfast as it’s gluten free, vegan and refined sugar free. This is my kind of breakfast!

## Recipe
### Ingredients

__For the pecan crumble topping__

* <span itemprop="ingredients">1 cup pecans toasted</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">1 cup <span class="highlight"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.gogoquinoa.com/products/quinoa-flakes-pre-cooked/">GoGo Quinoa Quinoa flakes</a></span> </span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">1 cup <span class="highlight"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.gogoquinoa.com/products/buckwheat-flakes/">GoGo Quinoa Buckwheat flakes</a></span> </span> </span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">&frac14; tsp ground nutmeg</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">&frac14; tsp ground cinnamon</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">1 pinch sea salt</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">12 dates chopped finely </span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">1&frac12; tsp vanilla extract or bourbon </span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">6 tbsps cold-pressed coconut oil (room temperature) + more for greasing the dish</span>

__For the filling__

* <span itemprop="ingredients">2 pounds of peaches and nectarines (could be one or the other but I like a mix) </span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">1-2 tbsps lemon juice (I like it with two but you can test the flavour with one and add more as you like)</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">1 tsp vanilla extract </span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">&frac14;-&frac12; cup of honey or maple syrup to taste depending on how sweet you want the filling </span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">1 tbsp cornstarch/or tapioca flour </span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">&frac14; tsp ground nutmeg</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">&frac14; tsp ground cinnamon</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">A pinch of salt</span>

### Directions

__For the topping__

1. Coarsely chop &frac14; cup of toasted pecans, then set them aside in a small dish. Put remaining pecans (&frac34; cup) in food processor and process them until they’re as fine as possible. 
2. In a medium bowl mix the the quinoa flakes, buckwheat flakes, salt, nutmeg, cinnamon, chopped pecans as well as the ground pecans together until combined. Then add the chopped dates to the mixed flakes along with the coconut oil and vanilla extract. Use your hands to mix until some large crumbs are formed. 

__For the filling__

1. Preheat oven to 375°F and grease your ovenproof baking dish. 
2. Halve and pit your peaches and nectarines, then slice each half into quarters smaller if they’re firm, large ones if the peaches are already soft. 
3. Place all the peach and nectarine slices in the prepared dish and toss them with the honey or syrup, cornstarch, vanilla extract, lemon juice, cinnamon, nutmeg and salt.
4. Cover fruit evenly with topping. Bake until crumble topping is golden brown in places and fruit is bubbling, about 40 to 50 minutes. If your topping starts to brown too quickly you can cover the top with foil until it is done baking.
5. Let cool slightly before serving, and serve ideally with a dollop of vanilla ice cream (dairy free to keep it vegan) or yoghurt as this makes a great breakfast.
