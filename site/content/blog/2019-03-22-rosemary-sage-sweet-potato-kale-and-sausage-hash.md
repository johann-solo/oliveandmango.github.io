A complete meal in a pan, and quite a satisfying one too, that’s exactly what this is. It’s perfect served for brunch with fried or poached eggs, and I have to admit there are many times we have whipped this up and gobbled it down for dinner.

The sage and rosemary give it a beautiful flavour and aroma. Sage and sweet potatoes are a match made in heaven. Not so much for my husband though in his experience. He once made us an awesome sweet potato mash with sage but added too much sage (recipe misread) and we both couldn’t even stand to take a bite. It’s super fragrant and you don’t need much to add the flavour you want. A little goes a long way. It has a sweet savoury flavour but can also overpower and can almost be a bit pungent if you go over board. Same with rosemary. So in this recipe you only need a pinch of both.

This is a real stick to your bones kind of breakfast. With eggs and a side of bread, some good hot sauce and a good strong coffee, you really can’t go wrong. Loved it and know you will too.

## Recipe
Serves 4 
</br>
</br>

### Ingredients

* <span itemprop="ingredients">2 sweet potatoes peeled and chopped into small cubes (approx 2 cups) </span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">4 sausages of your choice </span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">1 red onion cut in half and sliced thinly</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">1 green or red sweet bell pepper</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">1 bunch of kale washed, thick stems removed and chopped finely (approx 2 cups) </span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">2 cloves of garlic minced</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">&frac12; tsp of dried sage</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">&frac12; tsp of fresh rosemary</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">2 tbsp of olive oil </span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">2 tbsp of tomato ketchup (optional) </span>

### Directions

1. While chopping and prepping veggies heat a skillet on medium heat with 2 tbsp of oil and pan fry sausages for 3 minutes per side or until browned. 
2. Remove from pan let cool slightly and then slice them into &frac14; pieces and set aside
3. Add the chopped sweet potatoes right into the same pan and cook just until they all begin to brown approx 2-3 minutes. 
4. Turn the heat down to medium/low and cover pan and continue to cook the potatoes until they are fork tender, stirring often approx 3-4 minutes. 
5. Bring the heat back up to medium and add the sweet peppers and onions along with the sausage pieces and cook until the veggies are soft approx for 2-5 mins. 
6. Then add in your garlic, rosemary and thyme and sauté for a minute until very fragrant. 
7. Stir in the kale and let it cook with the rest for 1-2 minutes until it’s bright green and wilted. 
8. Season with salt and pepper to taste and at this point I stir in my tomato ketchup and sauté everything for a final couple of minutes, and then it’s ready to serve. This is totally optional but if you decide to do it you won’t regret it. It gives everything a slightly sweet glaze.
9. Serve hot with eggs and hot sauce and some toasted hearty bread.
