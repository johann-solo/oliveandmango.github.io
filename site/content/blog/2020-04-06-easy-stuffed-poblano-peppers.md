These stuffed poblanos are loaded with delicious southwestern flavours that I love. From the smokey chorizo to the tomatoes, corn and beans. These ones are stuffed  with quinoa too which adds a little more nutritional value to these stuffed peppers plus some extra texture too. They are finished off with melty cheese and then loaded with all the fixings. They are usually gone fast in our home but if there are any leftovers to fight over the next day, they reheat beautifully.

## What are poblano peppers? 
Poblanos are mild chili peppers originating in Mexico, and when dried are called ancho chile peppers. They are generally mild in flavor, but occasionally and unpredictably just like shishito peppers, can have significant heat. They are large like a green bell pepper but are skinnier and have a narrow and pointy tip, similar to jalapeños. Roasting is one of the best ways to cook poblano peppers since this allows their fruity flavors to shine. Grilling them is also a great way to have them.

## How do you cook poblano peppers?
There are so many ways to stuff poblanos just like there are so many ways to stuff regular peppers. We loved using chorizo for the meat component but you can use any sausage or ground meat. We always have a bit of cooked quinoa hanging out in the fridge and I thought it adds a nice texture to the filling and extra protein too. You can easily substitute it for any other cooked  grain you like though.

These stuffed peppers they are pretty mild  when it comes to heat levels. You can make them as spicy or mild as you like though. We love our heat - so spicy chorizo it is for us - but you can use a mild sausage or any ground meat you have on hand. You can also forego the jalapeño pepper and the chili powder too if you can’t do too much heat. They will still be delicious no matter the level of heat you make them in.

They make great appetizers or starters but you can easily make a meal out of these guys. I like to serve mine with a side salad and maybe some chips and salsa on the side. Enjoy!

### Directions

1. Preheat oven to 350°F and lightly grease or line a large baking sheet with parchment paper. Arrange halved poblano peppers in a single layer on the baking sheet and bake for 10-15 minutes
1. In the meantime heat up oil in large skillet to medium/high heat and add the chorizo, onion, garlic, and jalapeño and sauté until the sausage is cooked through, breaking up the sausage with a wooden spoon as it cooks. 
1. Add the spices and quinoa to the pan and stir well. Then add the tomatoes and chilies stirring well as you add each ingredient. Finally add the corn and beans, stir and allow to cook for 5-7 minutes until sauce is reduced a bit. Take off heat and you are ready to stuff the peppers with it. 
1. Spoon mixture into the peppers, sprinkle with cheese, and return to oven for another 10-15 minutes or until peppers are tender and cheese is melted. Allow to cool slightly before serving. Serve with chopped cilantro, salsa, and sour cream or any other topping you love. 

### Recipe Notes
No poblanos, no problem - swap them out for sweet green peppers or hatch chilies. Substitute diced tomatoes for salsa if you want a little more of a  zesty kick. You can also substitute the chorizo or Italian sausage with ground beef, turkey or chicken or keep it meatless if you want a vegetarian option
