This spring green salad combines the classic and delicious combo of peas and mint with a twist on a Lebanese fattoush salad adding crunchy cucumbers and radishes. Briny feta always adds a nice touch to this salad along with the lemony dressing. It’s the perfect salad to savour all the flavours of spring. It is also very versatile so feel free to throw in extra greens or green veggies of your liking like snow peas, shaved Brussels sprouts, aoragaus or chopped kale and romaine lettuce. It makes the perfect side or light main.

Spring has officially arrived here and the weather is starting to slowly show it. We are hopefully done with the well below zero temperatures from just a few weeks ago and looking forward to longer days and longer walks outdoors! This is just the right salad to help bring on the spring vibes even if it isn’t feeling all that springlike where you are. In fact I make this salad all year round as I love peas and cucumbers and all the ingredients in this salad and usually always have them on hand so it’s quite easy to whip up especially if you are using frozen peas.

## What is fattoush 
Fattoush, a traditional Lebanese salad, is a delicious combination of fresh veggies, a bright citrus dressing, herbs and toasted pita bread. Usually it’s made with chopped lettuce, cucumber, tomato, parsley, raddish, spring onion, mint, and often with chopped sweet peppers. My spring version uses green veggies.  I made this salad in partnership with Bob’s Red Mill using their <span class="highlight"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.bobsredmill.com/shop/grain-free-flatbread-mix.html/?utm_source=TheOliveAndMango&utm_medium=influencer&utm_campaign=bobsredmill">Grain Free Flat bread mix</a></span> to make my own flat bread to add in to the salad. I thought it was a great way to use the mix for a grain free addition to the ‘bread’ or ‘crouton’ portion of a fattoush salad. It’s an easy mix to use and your flat bread comes together in minutes - no proofing required and produces a crispy grain free and gluten free flat bread base. It has a subtle nuttiness and sweetness to it that my husband loves and he is pretty picky when it comes to anything gluten free. Bob’s Red Mill always has you covered with so many grain free options for baking and cooking for all your dietary needs.

## How to make Spring Green Fattoush
It’s a very simple salad to make with maximum flavour from the delicious and zingy dressing to all the crunchy veggies, fresh herbs and salty briny feta. Here is how to make it: 

* PREPARE the flatbread Either make your own homemade flatbread or you can use store bought flatbread or pitas or even naan bread. If you are using the Bob’s Red Mill flatbread mix you simply mix the flour with water, oil and eggs and then press it out into the size you want your flat bread to be, brush with the spiced oil and bake. See recipe notes below if using store bought pita or flat bread. 
* WHISK together all the dressing ingredients 
* CHOP all your veggies and blanch your peas, crumble your feta 
* TOSS all the salad ingredients together then toss with the dressing, break up your flatbread into pieces and toss into salad and enjoy!
