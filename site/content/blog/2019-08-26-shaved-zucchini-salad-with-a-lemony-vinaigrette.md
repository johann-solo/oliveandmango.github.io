If you have never had this salad or raw shaved zucchini in a salad you are in for a big treat. With paper thin shaved raw zucchini, a splash of lemon, some salty cheese and earthy nuts-this has to be the easiest and most versatile salad. Plus it goes with just about any summer food.  And best of all, it’s so delicious - and everyone I have made it for loves it.

It’s one of those recipes that comes in all shapes and sizes especially where the zucchini is concerned. I have seen versions of this salad where the zucchini is spiralized, or in others it’s peeled into paper thin ribbons and still in others it’s sliced into thicker sized coins. I am not a fan of spiralized zucchini or anything for that matter - yes I’m that person. So you won’t see me spiralizing anything any time soon.

I have also seen this recipe with a few different cheeses - from pecorino to Parmesan and even Asiago. I have also made it with feta. It’s great with any of those cheeses. It’s the same with the nuts. I did toasted almonds with this recipe but I have had it with toasted pine nuts and even walnuts. I added baby kale to mine to make it a more robust salad but that is totally optional and you can even substitute the kale for baby spinach as well. You can see why I said it’s a versatile salad.

The one thing that stays consistent is the zucchini in any shape or form you prefer. I know you probably have a few extra zucchini’s hanging around from your garden, or your neighbors, friends or parents garden and This is definitely how you should use some of them. Guaranteed you will love it!! Make sure and save a few zucchini though cause I have two more zucchini recipes coming at you this week.
