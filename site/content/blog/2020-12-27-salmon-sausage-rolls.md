These salmon sausage rolls make the perfect appetizer or finger food next time you are entertaining, or looking for a tasty snack, and are a lighter and delicious take on the ever-popular sausage rolls. They are made with simple pantry ingredients like canned salmon, store-bought puff pastry and fresh herbs. They are quick, easy to make and a crowd-pleaser.

There are so many different versions of sausage rolls out there most being made with some sort of ground meat. I do love my [Cheesy Sausage Stuffed Puff Pastry bites](https://www.oliveandmango.com/cheesy-sausage-stuffed-puff-pastry-appetisers/) but I wanted to make a lighter and even simpler version using salmon. This salmon option is simple to make using cooked canned salmon that mixes well with the rest of the ingredients to make a tasty snack. I played up the flavours of the salmon with some fresh and tasty herbs including dill and chopped chives along with fresh lemon juice and zest (the same sort of fresh herbs I like to use with smoked salmon) Instead of going heavier using cheese in the filling, I used horseradish cream adding extra flavour and just enough creaminess to the filling. Feel free to swap it out for cream cheese, mascarpone, creme fraiche, or even a spreadable herb cheese like Boursin if you want a creamier cheesier filling.

Traditionally Sausage rolls are made large enough to be a quick lunch, (which you can definitely do), I like making them into smaller, bite-sized portions. They are perfect game day snacks, or appetizer or small bites with cocktails. I love to serve mine with some tartare sauce but feel free to serve these little guys with whatever dipping sauce you like. If you want to play up the horseradish in these feel free to use more of the horseradish cream  as the dipping sauce or you can even do an herbed creme fraiche or sour cream sauce too.

When it comes to the herbs feel free to use what you have and what you like - I have made these into more Asian inspired salmon rolls by adding some miso paste to the filling instead of the horseradish cream along with some soy sauce and sesame oil and adding loads of chives for a different flavour profile and serving these with a sweet chili sauce. You really can get creative with the flavorings. I went simple and fresh with this flavour combo and it’s one of our favourites with the salmon. These make for such a tasty appetizer and I hope you guys enjoy them.

* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">&frac12; garlic powder </span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tbsp sesame seeds </span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Tartare sauce to serve </span>
</br>

### Directions
1. Place salmon into a bowl and flake with fork. Add breadcrumbs, egg, chives, dill, horseradish cream, salt, pepper garlic powder, lemon zest and juice. Stir well to combine.
2. Lay 1 pastry sheet on cutting surface. Mine was approx 10x9 inches. Cut in half to create two 10x4.5 inches. Place &frac12; of the salmon mixture in a sausage shape on the long side, pressing it gently. Repeat with remaining pastry and salmon mixture.
3. Fold one side of the pastry over the filling then brush the edge of the other side with egg wash and then roll it up and over the filling to overlap the edge of the other half, and then seal it well using your fingers. Gently flip the roll so that the seam is at the bottom. 
4. Transfer to baking sheet. Brush all over with egg wash and sprinkle with sesame seeds. Then transfer to the freezer for 10-15 min to firm up so that they are easy to slice without losing their shape. In the meantime preheat oven to 400°F. 
5. After they have chilled slice each roll into approx 1 inch pieces. Arrange them back on baking sheet and bake for 20-25 minutes or until golden. Serve with tartare sauce.
