This is one of my favorite salads to bring to a BBQ or to make if I’m hosting one. It’s a classic and it goes fast cause everyone loves it. It makes for the perfect side but can also be a meal. I love it for lunch – it’s just filling enough with the pasta and you get a lot of veggies in too. You can even add some grilled chicken to to make it an even more complete meal. It’s very simple to put together and the vinaigrette is just so delicious and also quite easy to make. It’s also quite versatile too.  You can defining add more or less of each of the veggies or feta and olives according to preference. I know I always use more than the amount shown of feta.

I’m a sucker for any kind of pasta salad but I’m definitely biased towards this one.  I messed about with my classic Greek salad recipe and all the ingredient amounts to give you this one which is really a [horiatiki](https://www.oliveandmango.com/classic-greek-village-salad-horiatiki/) with pasta. Tender pasta, ripe juicy tomatoes, crisp cucumbers, crunchy sweet pepper, briny feta cheese and olives, tossed in a Greek dressing, what could be better than that? 
This is also a perfect make ahead kind of salad. I always have some of this dressing in the fridge. It’s so versatile. The salad keeps well refrigerated for a couple days but I find the tomatoes can get a big mushy so I love chopping all my veggies for it in advance and storing them separate from the sliced tomatoes in a sealable bag. Then when I’m ready to make it all I have to do is cook the pasta and pop all the pre-chopped veggies in and toss it with the dressing. Simple and fabulous!

I used <span class="highlight"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.gogoquinoa.com">GoGo Quinoa</a></span> for this recipe and I truly loved the texture and shape of this pasta. I found it held up well and didn’t get too soft even after it had been in the fridge for a day. One thing I love about it was that it has more than one color.  It’s made of red and white quinoa and that is reflected in the pasta itself.  I use to love making pasta salad with tri colour pasta - my mom use to always use the tri colour for her pasta salad. This sort of reminds me of that pasta and the pasta salads me and mom use to make for family BBQ's and that’s why I chose this particular shape pasta for this salad. This is so uncomplicated and so very delicious and I really hope it makes it on your table - picnic or regular! Tell me what you think of it!
