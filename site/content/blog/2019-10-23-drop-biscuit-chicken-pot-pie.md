A comforting meal that is perfect for fall and winter when out come the warm clothes and you start preparing your favorite cool weather themed recipes. When you crave hearty and creamy dishes like this that warm the belly and can be served right out of the skillet. One pan meals are my favorite esp for the midweek. I appreciate a meal that I can just dump  things into one pan or pot and not think about prepping things separately. Definitely saves on cleaning multiple pots and pans which ultimately saves us some time as well.

The pot pie filling is loaded with flavour. I use bacon in my pot pie to start the first layer of flavours. The rest of the ingredients cook with the bacon and with the bacon fat building on those flavours. I love to add mushrooms to the usual mirepoix mix of carrots, celery, onions and garlic. They add a delicious meatiness and I just love them in it.

I decided to switch things up for the pot pie topping. Instead of doing a puff pastry crust or a pie crust covering, I decided to do a gluten free drop biscuit topping. I love a quick and easy drop biscuit recipe and I wanted to keep these biscuits GF. My go to way of doing that when it comes to baked goods is using <span class="highlight"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.bobsredmill.com/gluten-free-1-to-1-baking-flour.html">Bob’s Red Mill Gluten Free 1-to-1 Baking Flour</a></span>. It’s a simple to use flour blend that can replace all purpose flour in just about any recipe. Bob’s Red Mill offers whole grain foods in the country. All of its products are certified Kosher and made with ingredients grown from non-GMO seeds.

I'm pretty sure you are going to love this one - what’s not to love? - creamy, hearty filling topped with fluffy and buttery biscuits. Pull it out the oven, place it on the table and dig right in!

* <span itemprop="ingredients">&frac14; cup chopped fresh parsley </span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">1 tsp fresh thyme plus more for garnish </span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">Salt and pepper to taste </span>

__For the GF Drop Biscuits (makes 6-9 depending on size)__

* <span itemprop="ingredients">2 cups Bob’s Red Mill Gluten Free 1-to-1 Baking Flour</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">1 tbsp baking powder</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">&frac14; tsp baking soda</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">&frac12; tsp fine sea salt</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">2 tsp sugar </span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">6 tbsp cold unsalted butter, cut into 12 pieces</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">1 &frac14; cups buttermilk</span>

### Directions

1. Heat up a greased 8-10 inch skillet to medium heat, cook bacon for 5 minutes or until golden 
2. If using uncooked chicken breast, add it to the pan. (If using pre-cooked chicken, don’t add it until later) Cook chicken for 2-3 minutes per side with the bacon until slightly golden.
3. Add onion, celery, carrots, mushrooms and garlic. Cook for 5-8 minutes, until the veggies start to become tender. Make sure to season well with salt and pepper. Sprinkle pan with Bob’s Red Mill Gluten Free Baking Flour and stir vigorously for 1 minute to cook the flour a bit.
4. Slowly pour in the chicken broth and then the milk. Raise temperature up just a bit and let it come to a very gentle boil. Once it reaches a boil reduce the heat to a simmer and let cook for 8-10 minutes.
5. Add the chicken if using rotisserie, peas, parsley and thyme.  Let cook until the veggies are tender, and the peas and chicken are heated through, about 3-5 more minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
6. Preheat the oven to 425ºF while preparing the drop biscuits
7. Add the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and sugar to a deep bowl and whisk to combine or pulse to combine in a food processor. Scatter the butter over the dry ingredients and rub together with your fingertips, until it forms a sandy-looking texture with some pebble-sized pieces. If using food processor pulse a few times to achieve the same texture.  Pour in the buttermilk and stir until it just comes together into a thick dough and there are no visible signs of flour. This step should only take a minute: be careful not to overmix the dough. (I usually pour out my flour and butter into a bowl from the processor and stir in the buttermilk by hand instead of pulsing it in) 
8. Drop dollops of the dough over the top of the pot pie filling to mostly cover the surface. Transfer the skillet to the oven and bake for about 20 - 22 minutes until the biscuits are golden and the filling is bubbling.
