excerpt: A crisp chocolate tart with a Caribbean flair
---

Truth be told the motivation behind this recipe was a pack of ginger snap biscuits that were staring at me every time I opened the pantry cupboard. Ginger is fabulous with citrus and chocolate and so I was led to this beautifully smooth and creamy tart which was the last thing I shared with friends in Trinidad.

I had a little open house to giveaway and sell all our belongings and I decided to make something for friends to nibble on while they ‘shopped’ or to take home with them. This was what I came up with and it was perfect. It was a delicious cool treat for them. They all enjoyed it and raved about how creamy and delicious the filling was and how complimentary the lime was to the chocolate and ginger and I couldn’t agree more. It’s a great combo that gets tied well together with the coconut as well.

This is something I whipped up very quickly with minimal effort. What makes this tart so easy? The fact that I used ginger snap biscuits for the crust making it a no fuss kind of tart. I love tarts that use a biscuit base like graham crackers or any other biscuit for that matter, making them quick and easy to put together. Once the crust is baked off which literally takes minutes - the custard gets added to it and it goes in the fridge and done - the filling is a no bake one. Can it get any easier?

That creamy chocolate lime filling was a delicious combo because I’m one of those people who loves the combo of chocolate and citrus. I know many don’t or at least think they don’t but feel different after they tried it. I think you will love it. Milk chocolate can be quite sweet and dark chocolate can be quite strong in flavour and the fresh and bright oil in lime zest (or any citrus zest for that matter) livens up and balances out chocolate especially in this kind of a rich dessert.

What makes it so deliciously luscious and creamy? The custard itself is absolutely creamy and delicious but what I do with my custard after it’s finished and ready to be poured into the tart shell makes all the difference. I always pass is through a mesh sieve to make sure no little bits of anything remain in it ensuring you have the creamiest custard and thus the creamiest filling. It does add an extra step but it’s worth it for that creamy dreamy filling.

This tart was adored and will forever remind me of Trinidad and my friends whom I shared this little token of love with. The flavours are definitely inspired by the Caribbean with that touch of ginger, lime and coconut in each bite. Get a little taste of it by making this tart and you will adore it I promise!

* 4 large eggs
* 8 oz dark chocolate melted

* 1 tsp vanilla extract
* A pinch of salt

### Directions

__For the ginger coconut crust__

1. Preheat oven to 350 &deg; F

1. Place your cookies and shredded coconut in the food processor and process until finely ground. Add the melted butter and process until moistened and easily pressed together when tested.

1. Transfer to a 10 inch round tart pan with removable bottom, and press crumb mixture firmly onto the bottom of pan and up the sides. Place tart pan on a baking sheet and bake until golden and fragrant approx 10-15 minutes. Remove once done and set aside to cool completely before pouring in the filling

__For the chocolate lime filling__

1. In a medium sized bowl whisk the eggs lightly and set aside

1. Combine the sugar, cocoa powder, tapioca flour and milk in medium sauce pan set at medium heat stirring with a whisk until combined. Continue to cook over medium heat for 8-9 minutes until thick.

1. Temper the eggs before adding them to the cocoa mixture by taking approx half cup of the hot cocoa mixture and drizzling it into the eggs while whisking them. Once fully combined, drizzle the egg mixture into the hot milk mixture while whisking the hot mixture constantly

1. Bring the mixture back to a simmer over medium heat stirring constantly. Cook for 3 minutes and then remove from heat

1. Optional step but I love to do it for a perfectly smooth custard is pouring and pushing the custard through a fine mesh strainer into a bowl before pouring it into the tart shell.

1. Remove tart from pan and slice and serve with whipped cream, a dusting of toasted coconut and some lime zest and lime wedges.
