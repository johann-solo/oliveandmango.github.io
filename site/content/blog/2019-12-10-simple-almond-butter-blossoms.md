<span class="blog-text">

Soft and chewy with a chocolate centre - a classic cookie loved by all. These cookies go by so many names and are most often made with peanut butter. They are often called PB kiss cookies, thumb print Hershey kisses cookies and the list goes on. Whatever the name - they are delicious and are so good with PB or as I made them here using almond butter.

I always have almond butter stocked in the pantry and decided it was time to try these super simple cookies with it instead of peanut butter for a change. The idea for it came from a Greek Almond cookie I often crave that is called _Ergolavi_. It’s flavours are simple and so are the ingredients. I now think these are even better as they combine those same flavours but with a chocolatey centre. These are also a bit chewier as well which I love.

The Greek cookies I mentioned above are made with ground almonds; I decided to use <span class="highlight"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.bobsredmill.com/almond-meal-flour.html">Bob’s Red Mill Super-Fine Almond Flour</a></span> which is actually one of the most used flours in my pantry next to Bob’s AP flour. It’s great for baking with and give these cookies a delicious flavour and texture. Their almond flour is made from almonds, which have been blanched and ground to a fine meal that is ideal for gluten free baking. It’s a low carb flour alternative in place of bread crumbs in savoury dishes too like meatballs, or as a coating for chicken and fish. Just like all of Bob’s Red Mill products - this almond flour is certified Kosher and made with ingredients grown from non-GMO seeds.

These are so simple to make. They are one of my fav kind of recipes - bowl and spoon kind of recipes. They whip up in no time and the dough doesn’t need any resting time - they literally can be made in 15 minutes start to finish. You definitely can’t beat that. Rolling them in sugar before they bake is totally option, but I love the extra bit of texture they add to the cookies. Oh I also love that this recipe - which I adapted from PaleoRunningMom blog doesn’t make like 180 cookies like some recipes call for. It makes a modest 20ish which I can totally wrap my head around. Don’t kid yourself though those twenty will be gone in a flash so you better getting rolling and make a double batch.

### Ingredients

* <span itemprop="ingredients">2 cups <span class="highlight"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.bobsredmill.com/almond-meal-flour.html">Bob’s Red Mill Super-Fine Almond Flour</a></span></span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">½ tsp sea salt</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">½ tsp baking soda</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">¼ tsp baking powder</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">¼ tsp cinnamon </span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">¼ cup almond butter</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">2 tbs coconut oil</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">¼ cup coconut sugar or brown sugar</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">2 tbs pure maple syrup or honey</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">2 tbs almond milk or any milk</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">1 tsp pure vanilla extract</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">¼ cup granulated sugar for rolling cookies in</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">20-22 chocolate kisses unwrapped </span>


### Directions

1. Preheat to 350°F and line two baking sheets with parchment paper, and set aside. 
1. In a small bowl, whisk together almond flour, salt, baking soda, baking powder, cinnamon and coconut sugar and set aside.
1. Place the granulated sugar in a shallow bowl and set aside
1. Place the almond butter, coconut oil and maple syrup in a medium sized saucepan. Melt on low heat on the stovetop stirring until combined.
1. Remove from heat and stir in the almond milk and vanilla. 
1. Stir in the dry ingredients and mix until combined into a smooth batter 
1. Using a tbsp measuring spoon, scoop the dough into 1 tbsp portions and then roll into balls. Place the cookie ball into the bowl with the granulated sugar and gently roll around to coat in sugar. Then place on the lined baking sheets.  Do not worry about giving them too much space in between as these cookies do not spread out. 
1. Bake them in for 6-8 minutes or until the cookies look set and just began to crackle. Watch them carefully once you get to the 6 minute mark because the bottoms can get quite dark quickly. They continue to bake on the pan even out of the oven. 
1. As soon as the cookies come out of the oven, gently press one kiss into the middle of each one.
1. Allow them to cool on the baking pan for 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. Then enjoy.
