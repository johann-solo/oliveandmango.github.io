This is a wonderfully moist pumpkin spice bundt cake with the tastiest chocolate espresso swirl and a chocolate espresso rum glaze to top it off. This cake is easy to make and delicious on its own but the glaze really puts it over the top. I always make extra glaze and save it for [chocolate waffles](https://www.oliveandmango.com/dark-chocolate-waffles-with-cherry-balsamic-compote/) or even for drizzling on my [chocolate hazelnut espresso brownies](https://www.oliveandmango.com/chocolate-hazelnut-espresso-brownies/) if I’m feeling extra.  It’s just that good. You know I love pumpkin and chocolate together.  The addition of the espresso makes it an even more delicious combo with the pumpkin.

## How to make the perfect pumpkin bundt cake every time

Making this bundt cake is very easy. I strongly recommend sticking to to using canned pumpkin puree as opposed to homemade for this recipe as the texture changes quite a bit. Homemade pumpkin puree can be a bit more watery than canned and can affect the recipe outcome.  I have recipe tested it a few times using homemade and tried to trouble shoot ratios and change the dry ingredients and in the end the canned puree yielded the most consistent and predictable outcome. You can use any shape bundt pan you like just make sure to thoroughly grease every area of it. To help ensure I get into every nook  especially if I’m using a more intricate bundt pan i use a brush to dab in the butter or baking spray into those hard to reach edges. Once you have done that just give it a light dusting with flour and your are ready to mix your ingredients. Once you have your cake baked allow it to cool in the pan just for 10-15 minutes - no more. Then invert pan onto wire rack and allow cake to cool complete before glazing.  Usually it unnecessary to have to loosen edge of cake free if the pan has been well greased. If it needs a bit of coaxing just use a knife along the edges of the pan to loosen it.

## How it create those swirls in the cake or marbling effect

Whisk together your dry ingredients, and mix together the wet ingredients separately. Then mix the two together until incorporated. Whisk together the cocoa espresso ingredients and  to them and add 1&frac12; cups of the batter to create a chocolate batter. Starting with the pumpkin batter, scoop out 1 cup of pumpkin batter and add it to the bundt pan. Top the pumpkin batter with &frac14; cup chocolate batter. Add then &frac12; cup pumpkin batter over the top of the chocolate batter. Continue repeating layers to use up the remaining batter. That’s pretty much it. I will usually give my pan a little tap before baking it and then it goes straight in the oven.

Bundt Cakes are always showstoppers even when they are made in the most basic bundt pan. They are lofty looking cakes and usually dripping with some sort of delicious glaze.  This is the most perfect bundt cake for fall. The spices are not overpowering but just enough and the chocolate and espresso play well off them.  If you like your pumpkin baked goods to have a stronger spiced flavour feel free to add more to your liking. This bundt cake works really well as a plain pumpkin bundt cake too.  If you wanted to make it without the chocolate and the espresso just leave the batter as is and bake it without. You can also skip the glaze if you think its too much and serve it just as it is or with a dusting of powdered sugar.  It’s simple, its delicious and the perfect cake to make ahead.  It even freezes well. More details below on that. The best part is that the flavours in the cake continue to develop and the cake tastes even better a day or two after its baked so it’s just the cake to consider if you want to make something ahead of time if you are entertaining. It’s great for any occasion - hope you enjoy it!
