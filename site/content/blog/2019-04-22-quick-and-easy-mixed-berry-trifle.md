Trifle always makes me think of warm weather. Not that eating it should be limited to when it’s warm out, but the majority of trifles I have made and enjoyed have mostly been in the spring or summer at bbqs and picnics. They are great for warm weather as they are served cold and make for a very delicious and light dessert. Your typical layered trifle consists of some form of cake whether it’s pound cake or even lady gingers that are slightly soaked with a liquid usually made from citrus juice and there’s usually some sort of fruit involved that helps with the soaking as well.  A trifle also includes a custard layer and some whip cream on the top.

When it comes to my taste and preference in a trifle, I love a light one with plenty of fruit and a light lemon cream instead of a custard. I find the custard makes the dessert a bit too rich and ‘heavy’ for my taste and adding a custard adds more work so I made this one without. What you won’t find in this one is pudding or custard of any sort keeping this trifle simple, streamlined and oh so delicious.

I made this trifle with leftover <span class="highlight"><a href="https://www.oliveandmango.com/tsoureki-greekstyle-sweet-brioche-bread-sweet-mahlab-bread/">Tsoureki/(Greekstyle Sweet Brioche Bread) Sweet Mahlab Bread</a></span> if I’m making homemade). Our friend dropped off 4 loaves for us to enjoy. It’s just the tastiest. Tsoureki is Greek-style egg and butter enriched sweet bread or brioche that is flavoured with mastic/mastica, mahlab/mahlepi, cardamom and orange zest. Those flavours make this bread so fragrant and are classic to the Greek version of this style bread. We ate the first loaf right away and froze the others to keep them fresh. Leftover tsoureki can be enjoyed many ways. I love it toasted with a nice slathering of Nutella but it also makes for great French toast, baked or done by the slice. I thought I would try something a bit different with it this time around though. I found berries on sale and decided the best way to use them would be in a fruity dessert. Leftover tsoureki, a whole lot of berries - the answer was clearly trifle.  This is a very basic trifle recipe that can be made with pound cake or lady fingers and is most definitely not limited to tsoureki.

The flavourings are simple. I chose orange juice  in this version instead of my usual lemon juice because the tsoureki is infused with orange zest but either or works beautifully. Some people even add some liqueur to their tsoureki so if you would like to add a splash of Grand Marnier or a splash of Mastiha liqueur for some extra flavour feel free to add a splash or two. I made mine with lemon curd and whipped cream instead of custard, which as I mentioned earlier keeps this dessert light and delicious and very very simple to make. Feel free to use a store bought lemon curd to make this even quicker or make your own. My favourite recipe is by Ina Garten. I linked it in the recipe below.

This recipe can get thrown together in no time and is beautiful and delicious and perfect for entertaining and taking to a gathering. It’s always a hit and also a great way to use up leftover tsoureki or sweet bread. Enjoy!

## Recipe
</br>

### Ingredients
__Berries__

* <span itemprop="ingredients">4 pints or approx 8 cups of mixed berries </span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">1 orange, juiced (lemon alternatively for more tartness)</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">&frac14; cup honey (maple syrup or sugar alternatively)</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">1&frac12; teaspoons cornstarch</span>

__Lemon Cream__

* <span itemprop="ingredients">4 cups whipping cream</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">&frac12; teaspoon vanilla extract</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">1 (11-ounce) jar lemon curd or homemade lemon curd (I used <span class="highlight"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.google.ca/amp/s/www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/ina-garten/lemon-curd-recipe-1941910.amp">Ina Garten’s recipe</a></span> if I’m making homemade) </span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">1 homemade or store-bought tsoureki, sweet bread or brioche, sliced in &frac12;-inch thick cubes (store bought pound cake alternatively) </span>

### Directions 

1. Combine the berries, honey, cornstarch and orange juice in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Bring it to a simmer and cook just until the berries begin to break down and release their juices, about 3 minutes. Take the berries off the heat and allow to cool; the mixture will thicken up a little as is cools.
2. In the meantime whip the cream with the vanilla to soft peaks in a large clean bowl. 
* Put the lemon curd into a second large bowl and stir in approximately &frac12; cup of the whipped cream to lighten it up and then fold in the rest of the cream. It’s ok if some thin streaks of lemon curd remain. 
1. To assemble the trifle, spoon a layer of the lemon cream into a large glass bowl. Add a layer of pound cake. Then soak the cake with a layer of berries and their juices. Keep going to make 3 or 4 more layers, depending on the size of the bowl, finishing with a layer of lemon cream and garnish with fresh berries. Cover and refrigerate until ready to serve.
