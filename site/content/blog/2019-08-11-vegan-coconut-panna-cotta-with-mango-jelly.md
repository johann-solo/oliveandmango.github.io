description: A simple to make tropical creamy cool treat
---

 Panna cotta is such an easy and versatile dessert. It requires little effort and sets in the fridge making it a cool treat perfect for the summer.  I decided to give this panna cotta a tropical and vegan twist made easy with coconut milk and agar agar or agar powder. Agar powder is derived from red algae making it a vegan alternative to gelatin powder which is derived from animal products. This coconut panna cotta has a creamy pudding-like consistency and is slightly thicker in consistency than a regular panna cotta using gelatin.

One note about using agar powder is that a little goes a long way. It has a tendency to produce a more solid gel with less jiggle and creaminess if you add too much and doesn’t set as well when combined with acidic fruit or liquid that has a lot of additives or liquids. I love experimenting with agar powder and look forward to using it in many more vegan desserts.

I thought of many different pairings with this coconut panna cotta but kept circling back to mango. I love it and I miss having the best tasting mangoes while living in the Caribbean. There is nothing like mangoes off the tree. Of course coconut would be wonderful with just about any fruit - but I’m especially partial to it being paired with mangoes, passion fruit and pineapple. I said this recipe was versatile and it truly is when it comes to the jelly you decide to make it with. Feel free to substitute any fruit purée you would like for the mango jelly if you don’t have fresh or frozen mangoes available in your area.

It’s such a simple recipe and I just love making panna cotta. It looks super cute made in cups or ramekins. It’s great for company and the most perfect make ahead dessert. Hope you like it.
