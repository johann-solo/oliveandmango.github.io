This simple  Chocolate and Guinness stout loaf cake is made in one pan and is deliciously moist, tender, rich and so very chocolatey. It’s not overly sweet. After your first couple of bites, you'll notice that distinct subtle bitterness from the stout and the cocoa. The simple Irish cream cream cheese frosting blends perfectly with the slightly bitter crumb and will keep you going bake for more slices.

## Why use Guinness in baking? 
I love to cook with Guinness (ie. [My Guinness pie](https://www.oliveandmango.com/guinness-pie/)) and also bake with it. The toasty chocolate and coffee undertones of stout (such as Guinness) make it an excellent choice for incorporating into chocolate flavoured baked goods. It’s a total flavour booster in stews and in baking and especially with chocolate. We all know that coffee adds incredible flavours to chocolate baked goods. It deepens the cocoa flavours. Guinness does the same. An added bonus is that beer works as a gentle leavening agent. The carbonation in the beer helps cakes, quick breads, and muffins rise high.

Here is the break down:

This is easy to make, fudgy, and a tender crumbed cocoa cake with deep delicious robust flavours from the Guinness beer and cocoa. The rich, thick and creamy Irish cream frosting is the perfect accompaniment - enjoy responsibly meaning make sure and have more than one slice - and serve with a cold stout or warm one depending on how you like to drink yours.

* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">100ml Guinness stout beer </span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">&frac12; cup (40g) unsweetened cocoa powder </span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup (200g) brown sugar </span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">100ml whole milk</span>

* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup + 4 tablespoons (175g) all purpose flour </span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">¾ teaspoon baking soda </span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">&frac14; teaspoon salt</span>

#### For the Frosting
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 (8-ounce) package cream cheese, room temperature and softened</span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 teaspoon vanilla</span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoons <span class="highlight"><a href="https://www.oliveandmango.com/homemade-irish-cream">Bailey’s Irish cream</a></span></span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 &frac12; cups icing sugar</span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Cocoa powder for dusting (optional) </span>
</br>
</br>

### Directions 
1. Make cake: Preheat the oven to 350°F. Lightly grease loaf pan and line with a strip of parchment paper, so that the excess hangs over the sides of the tin (this makes for easy removal).
1. In a small bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda and salt.
1. Place butter into a medium size sauce pan and place over a medium heat until melted. Remove from the heat, and whisk in the Guinness and cocoa powder until smooth. Then whisk in the sugar, milk and eggs. 
1. Add the flour mixture to the Guinness mixture and whisk just until smooth and combined - do not OVERMIX. 
1. Pour the mixture into the prepared loaf tin and bake in the preheated oven for 40-45 minutes or until a skewer inserted into the middle of the cake comes out clean. 
1. Allow the cake to cool in the pan for 10-15 minutes before carefully lifting out; cool on a wire rack.
1. Make frosting: In a large mixing bowl beat the cream cheese with a hand mixer until soft and light. Add the vanilla and Irish cream and slowly add &frac12; cup of icing sugar at a time and blend in. Spread the icing on top of the cake and dust with cocoa powder if you wish.  Slice and serve 
1. Store leftovers refrigerated in a sealed container because of the cream cheese frosting

### Recipe Notes
* If you don’t have or want to use Guinness for this cake you can substitute it with Coca-Cola.  
* If you don’t have Irish cream or you’d prefer to keep this recipe free of any un-cooked alcohol, feel free to replace the Irish Cream with regular cream.
* How to ensure your cake is MOIST
Be very careful not to accidentally over-measure the flour and cocoa powder in this recipe. This will lead to dense, dry, or tough cake. The best way to ensure this never happens is to measure your ingredients by weight using a scale. Make sure to not over bake as well. If you don’t have a scale, then use the spoon and level method to measure your dry ingredients: start by fluffing the flour a little with a spoon to aerate the flour. Then you'll spoonthe flour into the measuring cup. You want to fill the measuring cup all the way to the top and let the flour flow over a little. Then, you'll use the back of a knife to level the top off.
