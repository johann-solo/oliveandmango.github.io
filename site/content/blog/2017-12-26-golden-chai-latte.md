excerpt: A spicy twist on the classic turmeric latte
---

There are many benefits to turmeric. It’s suppose to be plentiful in antioxidants, can be an natural anti-inflammatory and a good source of immune support. Likely you need plenty of it to see major health benefits, but small doses of good things like turmeric can do much for cumulative benefits too. This goes for fresh or ground. This locally made turmeric powder by Pure Organics is a wonderful one that is quite easy to incorporate into drinks, smoothies and of course some of our local dishes.

I love to drink it in golden lattes which are made up of a combination of turmeric and ginger along with some other warm spices.

This is my twist on a golden latte. I added a few extra warm spices that are very typically found in chai to give it a boost in flavour and I added some orange pekoe tea as well.

I am a tea and coffee lover and adding the orange pekoe tea is a wonderful choice in this warm drink.  Not only does it add a little more depth of flavour but is a great afternoon pick-me up or even replaces my coffee in the morning.

If you are trying to stay away from caffeine not a problem.  Skip the step of adding the tea bags in and go straight to the pour.

I like to add and blend protein powder to mine especially if it’s my morning drink. This gives me even more protein along with the nut milk.  You can even add soaked cashews to the blender for extra creaminess, texture and protein.

This is a wonderful soothing anti-inflammatory drink which I would actually call a treat! I’m always up for a spiced drink. If you are too than you will absolutely adore this latte.  Bottoms up and enjoy!
