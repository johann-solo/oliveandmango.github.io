This is a wonderful dish that is popular in many regions of Greece, especially during the Summer months when tomato season is in full swing and there’s so many tomatoes in sight, one doesn’t know what to do with them. Naturally you incorporate them into your scrambled eggs making them quite a delicacy. As you can imagine, there are many different variations of this dish with so many possible add ins but this is my favourite version and the one I make all the time and love.

Its a great meal that can be eaten anytime of the day. I love it as a light dinner with some toasted crusty bread and even a side salad. It’s one of those dishes that you could make into a full meal. It whips up as quickly as scrambled eggs making it a bachelors or bachelorettes delight.

Simple, quick and easy. You couldn't for anything more and it also uses pretty basic ingredients that are not hard to come by. Seems pretty ordinary - but it tastes anything but ordinary and a dish that you will be craving after you have it once.

It's simply [Mutti Finely Chopped Tomatoes (Polpa)](https://www.mutti-parma.com/can-en/mutti-tomatoes) quickly simmered, luscious olive oil added, then beaten eggs and our beloved feta (plus a few other aromatics) served over or with, some crusty bread and an extra drizzle of olive oil and even some bacon on the side (why not?). It’s usually a summertime favourite as I mentioned, that uses freshly grated garden tomatoes but when you have good as [Mutti Finely Chopped Tomatoes (Polpa)](https://www.mutti-parma.com/can-en/mutti-tomatoes) this becomes an all year round delicacy that you can have for breakfast, lunch or dinner.

We love this dish and it’s one we make often for breakfast but it shows up on the dinner menu often on the days when we just don’t feel like making a big meal or are too tired to and don’t want take out. We are pretty sure you will love it too and it will definitely become a staple on your menu as well!
