This Caramelized Beet Tarte Tatin with Feta is a delicious savory twist on a tarte tatin, a classic French caramelized, upside-down pastry that’s most often made with apples or other fruit for dessert. A touch of balsamic vinegar and brown sugar help caramelize the onions and the beets bringing out their natural sweetness. All on top of a buttery, flaky puff pastry crust — totally irresistible and perfect for a light meal with a green salad or an appetizer.

It’s a striking tart which goes perfectly with sprinkles of tangy/salty feta and garnished with micro greens or your favorite fresh herbs. There’s a few thing I really love about this tart. Not only is it a showstopper thanks to the colour of the beets but it’s also a meatless option if you are entertaining and need a tasty appetizer or meal.

There are two other things that make this recipe a simple one to make too. Using a good quality storebought all butter puff pastry is one of them and the other is using these organic cooked beets by Love Beets. They are organic, non-GMO, kosher and have no preservatives. Convenient and totally practical and make making this tart tatin quick and easy. That’s right - no need to peel or boil or roast - all the work is already done for you pre-packaging - which is such a time saver.

This is always a total hit and is the best served warm right out of the oven. Flip it onto a serving plate sprinkle with feta and greens, slice and serve.  Rustic and delicious. Enjoy!

## Recipe

### Ingredients

* <span itemprop="ingredients">Two 250 gram packages of <span class="highlight"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.lovebeets.com/products/organic-cooked-beets/">Love Beets Organic Cooked Beets</a></span> halved or quartered if they are large  </span>

* <span itemprop="ingredients">1 large red onion peeled and sliced finely  </span>

* <span itemprop="ingredients">2 tablespoons brown sugar</span>

* <span itemprop="ingredients">3 tablespoons butter</span>

* <span itemprop="ingredients">2 tbsp balsamic vinegar  </span>

* <span itemprop="ingredients">Salt and pepper</span>

* <span itemprop="ingredients">1 package store-bought puff pastry rolled out to &frac14; inch thick and cut &frac12; inch larger than the 9 inch pan  </span>

* <span itemprop="ingredients">&frac14; cup of crumbled feta for serving  </span>

* <span itemprop="ingredients">Micro greens for topping  </span>


### Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 375°F

2. Place the sugar and onions in a 9 inch cast-iron skillet. Once it begins to melt add the butter and the balsamic vinegar. Then add the red onion and beets.

3. Cook for about 3-4 minutes until onions are fragrant and starting to soften.  

4. Arrange the beet halves and quarters in a circular pattern with the rounded side down. Season with salt and pepper.*

5. Cover the pan with the puff pastry. Tuck in the edges around the beets. Poke 4 tiny holes into the crust with a knife for vents.  

6. Bake until the pastry is puffed and golden, 35-40 minutes  

7. Remove from the oven and cool for 10 minutes before inverting the pan onto a large plate, sprinkle with crumbled feta and garnish with micro-greens and slice and serve.  


### Recipe Notes

&ast; I emptied the pan after the onions and beets were pan fried and then arranged them in a clean pan for aesthetic purposes in these photos. Feel free to do that or use the same pan.
