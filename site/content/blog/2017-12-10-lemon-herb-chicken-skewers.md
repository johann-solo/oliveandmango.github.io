excerpt: A versatile meal with the freshest flavours

Let’s talk about how easy and delicious this recipe is! Great for grilling season which is all year round over here but also great done in the oven as well.  So much flavour is in every bite. I love the lemon flavours plus all the fresh herbs that make this dish so wonderful.

I developed this recipe in partnership with CGA and their new line of infused oils. All the oils are full of intense flavours that work so well with so many dishes. They are great in the dishes themselves and also drizzled on them too. The lemon is nice and intense just the way I think it’s should be.  The oil packs a lot of flavour but doesn’t have the acidity of lemon juice that is why I add a little extra juice of a lemon for the acidity but that is optional.

This is a great meal prep dish that you can make ahead and enjoy in wraps or even with rice or salad.  It’s perfect for all of those things. I like to make a double batch and then have the skewers available for lunches at least for a couple of days. It’s a versatile dish also. You can use any veggie you want if you wanted to replace one or more of them or if you preferred one over another.  I am sure these will be a hit in your home and hope you give them a try!

### Ingredients
Makes at least 10-12 skewers  
<br>

**for the lemon herb chicken and vegetable skewers**

* 1-1&frac12; lbs of boneless chicken breasts cut into cubes
* 1 clove of garlic minced finely or grated
* 4 tbsp Lemon infused coconut oil by CGA (alternatively olive oil with 1 tbsp of lemon zest)
* 4 tbsp of fresh lemon juice
* &frac14; cup of chopped fresh herbs of your choice- my classic combo for these skewers is basil and parsley
* 1 tsp dried oregano
* 1 teaspoon salt
* &frac12; tsp cracked black pepper
* 2 medium zucchini or yellow squash sliced
* 1 red onion chopped into square pieces
* 1 large red bell pepper cut into square pieces
* Bamboo skewers soaked in water approx 30-60 minutes previous to grilling
<br>

**for the Green goddess sauce (mayo free)**

* 2 cloves garlic
* &frac12; cup fresh basil
* &frac12; cup of parsley
* 1/3 cup of spinach (optional – could add more parsley and basil instead. I like to add more greens by adding the spinach)
* &frac12; cup Greek yoghurt
* 2 tbsp lemon infused coconut oil by CGA (olive oil alternatively with &frac12; tsp of lemon zest)
* 2 tbsp of fresh lemon juice salt and pepper to taste
<br>
<br>

### Directions  
<br>

**for the lemon herb chicken and vegetable skewers**

1. In a small bowl toss the chicken with the lemon juice, herbs, oregano, salt, pepper and oil reserving a couple tbsp of marinade for the veggies. Place in a sealed container and marinate for at least &frac12; hour but overnight is best.

1. Toss the veggies with the marinade in a separate container or sealable bag
and also let marinate for the same time.

1. Preheat grill to medium heat. Prepare your skewers by threading meat and veggies alternatively.  Grill for 10-12 minutes flipping them to grill evenly and until chicken is done.

1. Sprinkle with a little more salt and pepper when done and drizzle or brush them with more lemon infused coconut oil. Serve with pita bread and green goddess sauce. Recipe below.
