This Spicy Creamy Greek whipped feta dip just takes a handful of Ingredients to make and is great for any occasion and the perfect dip or spread to include on any mezze or cheese platter. It’s the second most famous dip after Tzatziki. Creamy, cheesy, spicy, this version includes chili peppers and is a total crowd-pleaser.

## How to pronounce Tirokafteri? 
I would say it’s one of the easier Greek words to pronounce - Tea-roe-cuff-terry. (Greek: τυροκαυτερή) It’s often referred to as Ktipiti (Greek: χτυπητή). I always distinguish the two by the type of peppers used I them. I have always referred to ktipiti when I make my dip with sweet roasted red peppers like my hubby’s fav dip on the blog [Roasted Red Pepper And Feta Dip](https://www.oliveandmango.com/roasted-red-pepper-and-feta-dip) and tirokafteri when I make my feta dip using hot Chilis. You can’t go wrong with either I say.

## What is Tirokafteri? 
Tirokafteri is a Greek feta dip. Tiri” or “Tyri“ in Greek means “cheese” and “kafteri” “spicy”. So the translation of Tirokafteri would be “spicy cheese” or “hot cheese”. The ingredients to make it differ from region to region but the basics include: feta, hot peppers, olive oil, lemon juice or red wine vinegar and garlic. Because feta has a dense and crackling texture - usually some greek yoghurt or some spreadable cheese or even a bit of heavy cream is added to the dip to achieve a creamy and spreadable consistency. Feel free to add as little or as much as you want to achieve your preferred consistency.

## What to serve with Tirokafteri ? 
It is traditionally served as a starter (meze) or eaten by itself, with warm crusty bread or pita bread. It can also be served as a sauce for grilled meats like [souvlaki](https://www.oliveandmango.com/greek-style-souvlaki-with-homemade-tzatziki/) or as a dip for vegetables like my [Zucchini Fritters](https://www.oliveandmango.com/zucchini-fritters) or my [Blistered Shishito Peppers](https://www.oliveandmango.com/blistered-shishito-peppers-with-a-lemony-whipped-goat-cheese-dip). I served it with my new favourite gluten free Oat Crackers from Bob’s Red Mill. They make the perfect crunchy vessel to carry this dip on. They make the perfect addition to any platter including this mezze platter. They come in 4 delicious flavours and unlike other gf crackers they deliver on crunch with no waxiness. This a glass of wine and some friends and you have the makings of a perfect Mediterranean night!

## How to make a mezze platter? 
A mezze platter is an easy, fun, and family-friendly dinner! What tapas are to Spain, mezze is to the Mediterranean including places like Greece, Turkey, North Africa, and parts of the Middle East. Mezze (or meze) is an assortment of small dishes eaten as appetizers or a light meal that is meant to be shared. Its contents vary by region, but the concept of grazing on a board filled with savory goodies remains the same. A Greek mezze platter usually includes some kind of dip like this [Tirokafteri or Hummus](https://www.oliveandmango.com/creamy-hummus-and-white-bean-dip-with-roasted-garlic-and-rosemary) and [Tzatziki](https://www.oliveandmango.com/easy-tzatziki-sauce-garlic-yogurt-cucumber-dip), some type of bread, such as [pita](https://www.oliveandmango.com/fresh-homemade-pita-bread) or a crusty bread or crisps as I have shown here, is standard, along with things like olives, cheeses, fresh and pickled vegetables, dolmathes or stuffed grape leaves, and I love to serve mine with [Keftedakia Greek meatballs](https://www.oliveandmango.com/turn-your-mezethakia-into-a-meal) and my [Greekstyle baked white beans](https://www.oliveandmango.com/gigantes-plaki-greek-style-baked-white-beans), and mini Spanakopita either my [traditional recipe](https://www.oliveandmango.com/traditional-homemade-spanakopita-easy-from-scratch-greek-spinach-pie) or my [Crispy Spanakopita Spring Rolls](https://www.oliveandmango.com/crispy-spanakopita-spring-rolls). Really there are no rules to what you add to your platter- fill it with all the things you love. Kali orexi!!!!

### Recipe Notes
* After chilling it, its common for it to stiffen up or become a little denser. Make sure to give it a good stir before serving it again. 
* Greek yoghurt substitute: heavy cream, ricotta, or softened mascarpone or cream cheese
* Feel free to char, broil,  grill, roast or slightly fry the pepper before chopping to add some smoky flavour.  If you don’t have red chili peppers feel free to use green ones. You can also use jarred chili pepper - I love the ones packed in oil!
