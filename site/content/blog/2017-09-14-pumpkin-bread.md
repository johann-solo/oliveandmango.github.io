### Updated Nov 1st 2020

This tasty tahini pumpkin bread is moist, sweet, and perfectly nutty. It's loaded with nuts and dates and topped with crunchy pumpkin seeds and sesame seeds. This pumpkin bread recipe was given to me by a friend and I have been waiting until the fall season to try it and share it. I modified it to suite my taste.  And I wanted to turn it into a date and nut tahini one so I'm so happy it turned out so well. I reduced the amount of sugar and removed the chocolate chips and raisins too. I also use coconut oil and coconut sugar in the bread whenever I make it but a neutral vegetable oil and brown sugar are perfeclty fine in this recipe too.  I haven't yet tried it with flax eggs but I am sure this would be a fabulous vegan recipe if you swapped out the 2 eggs for flax eggs.

The pumpkin makes this the ultimate moist bread and the tahini paste although just 3 tbsp, flavours the entire bread beautifully.  I am a lover of tahini or sesame paste so if you are too, you will love this bread. I actually shared this with some who had never had tahini and they loved it, so if you're not too sure about it, go ahead and give it a try and you might be pleasantly surprised.

I like to use my own homemade pumpkin purée which is super simple to whip up in this recipe and so many others. I make my own when i can instead of getting it in a can because it's got no additives, preservatives, tastes a lot better, and is way way way cheaper in Trinidad to make it then to buy it canned. I usually make a huge batch and measure it out in cups and I freeze it so I always have some on hand for soup, this bread, muffins and whatever else I want to add it in. We were loving this bread just as it was but also toasted with more tahini over it! Hope you give it a try!

## Homemade Pumpkin Purée

### Ingredients

* 1 whole pumpkin 4-6 lbs or cut pumpkin pieces
*  Pinch of salt
</br>
</br>

### Directions

1. Preheat oven to 400°F
1. Line one or two baking sheets with parchment paper
1. Slice pumpkin open and scoop out the seeds and fibers (reserve seeds for roasting or something else at another time) and cut up into 1-&frac12; inch square pieces removing the skin
1. Arrange the pieces on baking sheet or sheets and sprinkle with salt and then roast them for 20-40 minutes until fork or knife can easily be inserted
1. Let sheet cool on cooling rack until you pumpkin can be handled and then transfer it all to a food processor and process until the flesh is smooth. Store in the fridge for up to one week and freeze for up to 3 months.

&#42; You can also cut the whole pumpkin in half and roast pieces whole but this takes longer to roast and more work to scrape off the flesh from the skin after. I do both and result is the same it just depends on how much time I have on hand and how lazy I am to chop and peel the pumpkin.

&#42; you can also boil the pumpkin in water until softened and water evaporates but I prefer roasting it because it develops a unique sweetness and a nuttiness as well
