These baked ravioli bites are super crispy and addictive to eat dipped in a tasty [marinara sauce](https://www.oliveandmango.com/easy-fresh-tomato-marinara/). They are easy to whip up and will be your new favorite appetizer or snack. Ravioli is coated in egg and an Italian-spiced panko breadcrumb mixture and baked til perfectly golden and crisp. No need to deep fry these little guys to get them nice and crispy - this lighter healthier version is simple and quick to make and the recipe is air fryer friendly too.

This Italian-American treat hales from St. Louis, Missouri and is a popular appetizer at many restaurants. Traditionally they are breaded and deep fried. Since I don’t love deep frying, I decided to bake them up until crisp. They turned out perfect - seasoned just right and crispy all over. Plus so much easier and healthier than deep frying.

What you will need to make Crispy baked ravioli bites:

* Fresh not frozen ravioli (cheese is my preferred filling for these) 
* Bread crumbs - regular or panko - can also use Italian seasoned bread crumbs too and omit the Italian seasoning from the recipe 
* Finely grated parmesan cheese 
* Herbs and spices to season these little bites 
* Marinara sauce for serving and dipping them (my homemade fresh <span class="highlight"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.oliveandmango.com/easy-fresh-tomato-marinara/">Marinara sauce</a></span> is so easy and delicious)

The simple trick to making them crisp all over is baking them on a cooling rack over your sheet pan - this allows the top and the bottom of them to get nice and crispy. If you don’t have a cooling rack that fits onto your baking sheet, they can be baked straight on the lined baking sheet itself but you will need to flip the ravioli halfway through the cooking time instead. Feel free to use any shape ravioli you would like. Using fresh ravioli will yield he best result as opposed to frozen. You could thaw the frozen ones and then prep them the same way but they tend not to get as crispy as the fresh ones.

They go pretty fast when I make them and so I tend to make extra for just that reason. Who could resist crispy edged cheese filled pasta bites? Definitely not me. I think you might feel the same once you try them too.

### Ingredients

* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 lb (453 grams) fresh ravioli (not frozen - any flavour you like) </span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 eggs</span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tbsp cream or water</span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup panko breadcrumbs or regular bread crumbs </span>

</br>

### Directions
1. Preheat oven to 425°F. Place wire cooling  rack on top of rimmed baking sheet and grease with cooking spray and set aside. 
2. In a shallow dish whisk the eggs and cream or water until well combined. 
3. In a separate shallow dish, whisk together the the bread crumbs, parmesan, Italian  seasoning, garlic powder, onion powder and salt. 
4. Dip the ravioli in the egg mixture, letting the excess drip off, then coat with the breadcrumb mixture pressing it on. Place them on baking sheet. 
5. Spray tops of ravioli with cooking spray the bake them for 15-20 minutes or until tops are golden brown and crisp. Baking time differs depending on brand and size of ravioli. 
6. Serve warm with marinara sauce for dipping, and sprinkled with extra parmesan cheese on top and chopped fresh parsley or basil.

### Recipe Notes 
* You can bake these right on a lined baking sheet if you prefer that juts flip halfway through baking - I use the rack because it ensure all edges get super crispy. 
* You can also use an air fryer to make these if you have one. Place them in air fryer in single layer and set at 350°F for 6-9 minutes each batch.
