Minestrone is a classic Italian thick vegetable, bean and pasta soup that is hearty and wonderful on a cold day. I already have a very delicious one on the blog but not a vegan one. Im working with _GoGo Quinoa_, an awesome Canadian company as you know, to come up with vegetarian and vegan friendly meals with a new line of their products. It’s always exciting to come up with fun and pretty easy recipes in collaboration with them. I love doing the research and testing recipes. It’s a fun process and building a recipe from many and adding your own twist to things takes some work but in the end it’s very satisfying and usually quite delicious.

I decided to use <span class="highlight"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.gogoquinoa.com/products/lentil-quinoa-rotini">GoGo Quinoa Lentil & Quinoa Rotini</a></span> in a minestrone recipe. As I mentioned above I already have a classic [minestrone recipe](https://www.oliveandmango.com/classic-minestrone-soup/) on the blog and all you have to do with that one to make it vegan is omit the cheese and the pancetta. Not a big feat but I wanted something a bit different. I came across several green minestrone recipes on line and I was intrigued. That was definitely the route I wanted to take - a green twist on minestrone was the way to go. You all know how much I love my greens so this was the perfect soup for me to get on the blog, easily made vegetation/vegan and a soup that any one will enjoy not only someone who is vegan. Plus I’m pretty much done with winter and wanted something green and something springlike on the blog, but hearty enough as unfortunately spring is still several weeks away and if we are talking spring-like weather - that could be a couple months away.

The <span class="highlight"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.gogoquinoa.com/products/lentil-quinoa-rotini">GoGo Quinoa Lentil & Quinoa Rotini</a></span> pasta is already loaded with protein and fiber making this soup a powerhouse of veggies, greens, protein and fiber. My kind of soup for sure. This pasta, just like the rest of _GoGo Quinoa’s_ pasta has a nice textual bite to it and was perfect in this soup. But a warning with all minestrone soups and any pasta you use in a minestrone soup, is do not add the pasta in too soon, to avoid super soft and mushy pasta. Some people cook the pasta separately and add it in to each serving bowl they dish the veggie broth into. That is a great idea and if you are really nervous about your pasta going too soft, that may be a great option for you. But in order for me to keep this a one-pot meal, I added the pasta to the pot at the last few minutes of cooking time, knowing that the pasta will still cook even after the pot is off the heat. The texture of the pasta was just perfect as I served it out.

I love to serve my minestrone soup with a dollop or a swirl of pesto in it along with some crusty bread. I make my pesto with any greens I may have. This one I made with baby spinach  but the classic basil pesto version is always great too.  It adds even more flavour to the soup and makes it even more luscious. I have the simplest bean pesto recipe bellow that is just wonderful in anything you would use pesto in - pizza, pasta.....etc, and bonus for this recipe - you add more greens to an already green soup.

If you are looking for a way to switch up your minestrone, this is it. Not only is it healthy and full of veggies and greens, but simple to make, super flavourful and filling.

* <span itemprop="ingredients">&frac12; - 1 cup <span class="highlight"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.gogoquinoa.com/products/lentil-quinoa-rotini">GoGo Quinoa Lentil & Quinoa Rotini</a></span>

* <span itemprop="ingredients">1 cup of greens either Swiss chard, Tuscan Kale or spinach, stems removed and chopped</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">Salt and pepper to taste </span>    
* <span itemprop="ingredients">Serve with pesto and chopped or sliced parsley and or basil (simple pesto recipe below) </span>

### Directions

1. Heat olive oil in a large Dutch oven on medium. 
2. Add bay leaves, garlic, onion, Italian seasoning, leeks, celery and carrot. 
3. Sauté for 5-7 minutes until the leek start caramelizing and veggies start to get tender. 
4. Add the wine if using and allow to simmer for a couple minutes until reduced
5. Add zucchini, potato, peas, green beans, tomato, and cook stirring for another couple of minutes then add the cannellini beans and stock.
6. Bring to a boil and then reduce heat to medium-low and simmer uncovered for 20-25 minutes.
7. Increase heat to medium. 
8. Add the Pasta and mix gently. Allow to cook for for just a minute or two minutes until the pasta is just al dente, remembering that it will continue to cook off the heat as well. Over cooking will lead to very soft mushy pasta so add the pasta at the very end.

11. Serve hot in bowls with a drizzle pesto, and torn basil leaves and or parsley.
