excerpt: A creamy and sweet carrot dip perfect for any occasion
---

There’s is nothing like the nutty and earthy flavours that come with roasting veggies in general. Root vegetables carrots included also become intensely sweet and fabulous. Roasting the carrots with onions and garlic really marries the flavours together even before they all get blended up in the food processor.

I love a little bit of heat in my dips and that is why I loved adding the ground harissa to these carrots. It adds so much flavour and you don’t need plenty. Feel free to adjust amounts according to your liking and degree of heat tolerability. If you are strongly opposed with adding the heat then feel free to treat it like hummus and just replace the harissa with ground cumin.  I have had it both ways and both ways are fabulous.

This dip has a nice natural sweetnesses and is perfect served up with crispy pita bread or pita chips and perfect with some crispy crackers. Nut thins are super crispy and salty and I loved having it with those.  I also love it in my sandwich and on toast with some cloves tomatoes.  My husband loved it with my [homemade Rosemary Cranberry crisps](https://www.oliveandmango.com/rosemary-cranberry-crisps/) that have a slight sweetness to them as well.

The tahini adds a wonderful flavour but also helps make this dip extra rich. You will love how creamy and delicious this dip is and it’s the perfect addition to a cheese board and great as a party dip or an appetizer. It’s also so simple to make and can easily be made in advance.  It is also dairy free so even the vegans in your life will be able to indulge.  Hope you give it a try and add it to your list of delicious dips.
