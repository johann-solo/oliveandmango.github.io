Baking up a quick bread or loaf cake recipe is always one of my favourite things to do when I want a quick and easy baking project. This blueberry lemon bread is really easy to make and doesn’t require you even pulling out the mixer. It’s an easy bowl and whisk recipe that I make often, especially when berries are in season and plentiful. You guys really love all my my lemony desserts on the blog like my [lemon bundt cake](https://www.oliveandmango.com/lemon-bundt-cake) and my [lemon olive oil cake](https://www.oliveandmango.com/lemon-olive-oil-cake) so I wanted to share a simple version of this classic blueberry loaf cake infused with lemon zest and lemon juice.

## Blueberry Lemon Loaf cake ingredients: 
This tasty lemon loaf cake with blueberries is made with very basic ingredients but there are a few that can be easily substituted so I thought this recipe warranted a list of them  so here are the basic components of this loaf cake: 
* Blueberries - You can use fresh or frozen blueberries.  I have used frozen blueberries in this bread many time. Frozen ones do not need to be thawed before adding them to the batter. Feel free to use another berry variety if you prefer - like chopped strawberries, or raspberries or blackberries. 
* All purpose flour - feel free to use a really good quality 1-1 gluten free all purpose flour in place of it if you are making this recipe a gluten free one 
* Greek Yoghurt - you can replace this with regular yogurt or sour cream 
* Olive oil - I love the flavour olive oil gives this cake. If you would like to use a milder flavoured oil you can replace it with a neutral vegetable oil you like. 
* Lemon zest and lemon juice. Necessary ingredients when making a lemon blueberry loaf. Freshly squeezed lemon juice is always best for the best flavours.

## Tips on making the best blueberry lemon loaf cake 
* Toss your berries with a little flour as this helps them from sinking to the bottom of the batter. 
* Ensure the oven is preheated to the right temperature before placing loaf in the oven. This will ensure that it bakes evenly. 
* An average size lemon will provide you with about 3 tablespoons of lemon juice - you will need I for this this recipe for the bread and glaze. 
* Do not over-mix the batter - a few streaks of flour remaining in batter if fine. Over mixing can effect the texture of cake. 
* Be careful not to over bake. I tend to check my cakes 5-8 minutes before they are supposed to be done as listed in any recipe as oven temperatures vary and naturally that would mean so do baking times. 
* Sift the dry ingredients into the batter. This makes the dry ingredients easier to mix into other ingredients when forming a cake batter. It’s optional but recommended.

### Directions

1. Preheat oven to 350°F and grease 9x5 loaf pan with baking spray or line with parchment paper and set aside.
2. Toss the blueberries with 1 tablespoon of flour and set aside.  
3. In small bowl combine the lemon zest and sugar. Mix together with your fingers until zest is coated with sugar and sugar is infused. 
4. In large bowl add the sugar zest mixture and whisk in the eggs and the oil until well combined. 
5. Then whisk in the yoghurt, lemon juice and the vanilla.  
6. Sift the flour, salt and baking powder right into the wet ingredients then whisk until just combined. Do not overmix. It’s ok if there are still a few streaks of flour in the batter. 
7. Fold in the blueberries until combined. 
8. Pour the batter into the loaf pan and smooth the top of batter.
9. Bake for approximately 50 minutes or until top is golden brown and tester comes out clean. Allow loaf to cool in pan for about 10 minutes then remove the bread from the pan and allow it to cool completely on rack.
10. While bread is cooling make the glaze: In small bowl whisk together the powdered sugar, lemon juice and the cream until smooth. Add more sugar or more juice to obtain desired consistency.
11. Drizzle glaze over the cooled loaf. Serve immediately or store bread in sealed container. Loaf can be stored in a sealed container at room temperature for 3-4 days.

### Recipe Notes
* To freeze loaf cake: Let the bread cool completely first. Then wrap in plastic wrap, followed by foil and then place in a freezer safe airtight container or ziploc bag for up to 3 months. Thaw in the refrigerator.
