Pomegranate molasses has become one of my favourite ingredients. It’s a great little syrup that can be used in so many different ways. You can even make your own reducing pomegranate juice with or without sugar until it’s a thick syrup.  Doing that would cost a pretty penny here with the cost of pomegranates so it’s a more reasonable option to buy the actual prepared syrup or molasses.

It has a wonderful sweetness with a bit of tartness and the familiar slight bitterness of most molasses. It can be used in salad dressings, great in Mediterranean dips, great as a glaze for meats, can be added to drinks and cocktails and even drizzled over grilled or roasted veggies. The options are pretty endless.

When I saw this recipe in Delicious magazine I had to check it out. I was curious about what they used in the cake to make it a pomegranate one. I checked it out and it was a fabulously simple recipe using pomegranate molasses so you know what that means – I had to make it.

The combination of the pomegranate molasses and orange water blossom give this cake a bright and fragrant flavour. The cake itself is a little on the heavier side.  The reason for that is that it’s a soaked cake. After it bakes and cools you poke holes into it and pour the molasses into it giving it a syrupy moist texture and making it a little heavier like any other syrupy cake. I love these kind of cakes. Greeks make a couple of cakes this way and I adore them.  We soak ours in honey or a sugar water syrup. Lovely notes of citrus run through the syrup and make the cake so irresistibly delicious!  So you can imagine that I had to give this recipe a try.

The original recipe called for a mascarpone icing and I absolutely love mascarpone icing but I thought this cake would be lovely with a lighter more airy frosting since it’s a little weightier.  It turned out wonderfully and so glad I made it and know you will too. Check out the Delicious Magazine website for the original recipe to get the mascarpone icing.  Whatever way you chose to frost it will be fabulous!
