I made a cocoa butter mash not too long ago and I had a really hard time locating cocoa butter on an island that boasts some of the best cocoa in the world. I have had several people ask me where to get it here on the island and we just have to laugh at how hard it is to locate. Since then thankfully I have seen it being sold in a few locations which is great as I’m posting this recipe which uses cocoa butter in it! I still had a remaining stash of cocoa butter from those mashed potatoes (which were amazing by the way - [check the recipe out here](https://www.oliveandmango.com/white-chocolate-mashed-potatoes/)) I made with it and I just knew I would come across a recipe to use it in.

That is when I came across Minimalist Bakers recipe for vegan chocolate mousse. I knew I had to make it and I’m so glad I did. When I asked people to guess what was inside it - the most typical response was avocado and aquafaba. Both make fabulous vegan things but no one guessed cocoa butter. The cocoa butter gives this mousse the fat and richness a  really good mousse has. The dates give it sweetness and body and blending it gives it the airiness of a regular chocolate mousse.

We had a hard time waiting for it to fully set before digging into it. It was so delicious, creamy and light and we could not get enough. This most definitely is a dessert that will be enjoyed by anyone and everyone not just the vegans in your life. You will love the creamy texture. Although it may not be as airy as a mousse made by whipped eggs whites, it’s still light enough. I really didn’t have the highest hope for it to taste too mousse-like and actually was pleasantly surprised at how light yet rich tasting it is.  You can carve into like a mousse. As it warms though it will predictably become a little creamier which I think is totally fine. Remember no eggs here so it’s not going to have the same texture as that kind of a mousse but close enough for me!

You totally have to give this recipe a try. If you like dark and rich chocolatey desserts you will love this. I added the the espresso power to it which is just enough to enhance and deepen the richness of the cocoa flavour. Feel free to tip a little more of it  in if you want a mocha flavoured  mousse.  The original recipe called for carob powder but had none so I think the coffee powder was a great alternative. Feel free to use decaf if you want or leave it out completely - but I strongly recommend leaving it in. You will love this dessert and do let me know what you think of it and definitely send me your snaps of it if you do!

### Recipe
### Ingredients 

* <span itemprop="ingredients"> &frac12; cup + 1 Tbsp unsweetened cocoa powder or cacao powder</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients"> optional: 1 tsp- tbsp of  instant espresso/coffee (optional but strongly recommend) </span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients"> &frac34; cup chopped cocoa butter (or sub vegan bittersweet/dark chocolate)</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients"> Pinch sea salt</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients"> 1 14-ounce can full-fat coconut milk, divided</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients"> 1 tsp pure vanilla extract</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients"> 1-2 tbsp of maple syrup to sweeten</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients"> 6-9 pitted medjool dates </span>

### Directions 

1. In a small saucepan heated to Med-low, combine cocoa powder, espresso powder, cocoa butter, salt, and &frac34; cup coconut milk. Whisk constantly until melted
1. Once melted, whisk in the remaining coconut milk and remove from heat.
1. Whisk in the vanilla extract and maple syrup  to taste remembering that the dates will also add sweetness. 
1. Transfer the mixture to a blender carefully as mixture is hot. Add dates starting with 5 and increase to taste (I usually end up using all 9 especially if they are small)  and blend on high until creamy and smooth.
1. Transfer to a bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Or transfer to individual cups or ramekins and wrap individually. Refrigerate until cold and thickened - at least 4 hours, preferably overnight.
1. I served mine with coconut whip a dusting of cocoa powder and some sliced almonds. They are good refrigerated for up to 5 days - but trust me they will not last that long. 


## Coconut whip cream

### Ingredients

* 1 can of coconut cream/or a thick milk
* 1 tsp of pure vanilla extract
* ¼ cup powdered sugar

### Directions

1. Place the can of coconut cream in the fridge for a few hours or overnight - or in the freezer for 30 min to an hour to allow the milk fats to solidify
1. Open the can and drain out the liquid part reserving the solid creamy milk fat- you can save the liquid part to drink or add to smoothies
1. Place the milk solids in a large mixing bowl and beat with a mixer until light and fluffy
1. Add the vanilla and sugar if you want it sweetened and mix until well combined – I don’t usually sweeten; I leave as is because I find it has a natural sweetness and it contrasts well with the sweetness of the cake.

### Recipe Notes

* A note about the coconut whip. I learned from experimenting that the milk fats must be pretty solid when you remove them from the can so that they whip up well. Also if you’re having trouble getting it to whip try a different brand of coconut cream or milk. You really need a thicker kind of coconut milk not the really watery ones without a lot of fat.
