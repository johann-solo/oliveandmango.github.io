There really isn’t anything better or more decadent than homemade risotto. This one is made even heartier and creamier with the addition of juicy shrimp and mushrooms. For extra creaminess I also added avocado - if you haven’t had risotto with avocado you are missing out and it’s a must to try.  Another unique factor in this risotto is that I added milk to my risotto. It adds to the wonderful creaminess of the risotto.

Milk in risotto is not a new thing. Risotto al Latte is a real thing and it’s incredibly creamy, decadent, and stems from Venice. It’s usually made with only milk almost like a savoury rice pudding. It’s delicious and I thought I would incorporate a bit of that receipt into this one. I made this risotto in partnership with Metro featuring _Dairy Farmers of Ontario_ and thought this was a great recipe to share with you guys as I love adding milk to my risotto. You won’t be standing over a hot stove for 20 minutes, constantly stirring and adding broth a ladleful at a time with this risotto making this a pretty easy and less intimidating or intensive risotto recipes. The liquid is actually added in 2 batches, and you only need to stir occasionally. Using a wide shallow pan helps - it allows the broth to evaporate at about the same rate that the rice is cooking, leaving behind a creamy risotto and with only 2 additions of liquid and less stirring.

There are many opinions on what makes a great risotto - almost like there’s many about what makes a good porridge. In the end it’s all about person preference. I’m not here to tell you what is traditional or not when it comes to risotto either. I’m just sharing a tasty way to enjoy it with a variation of add ins that I love. I like mine on the al dente side and a bit runny. I know it will thicken as it cools so for me that works best. If you like yours thicker just simmer and stir it for an extra couple of minutes. And season well with salt and pepper according to your taste.

## How to make Creamy mushroom shrimp and avocado risotto:
This risotto is quite simple to make. The steps are easy to follow.
* Sauté the mushrooms and the shrimp separately, seasoning them well, then set them aside to add in towards the end 
* Sauté the shallots and the garlic until softened and deglaze the pan with wine (wine is optional - can use broth to deglaze if you are abstaining) 
* Stir in the rice and then &frac23; of the broth and bring and keep to simmer for 5 min - stir then simmer for another couple of minutes before adding the remaining broth and milk 
* Once your last addition of liquid is added simmer for another 5 min then add in the Parmesan cheese and avocado and stir vigorously for a few seconds
* Stir back in the shrimp and the mushrooms and gently simmer to heat them through then serve with the extra Parmesan cheese and fresh herbs for garnish.

### Directions
1. In a large sauté pan, add 1 tablespoon of olive oil, along with the mushrooms and sauté over medium-high heat until they are softened and golden, 3-4 minutes. Season with salt and pepper, remove onto plate and set aside. 
1. Add remaining olive oil to pan along with the shrimp. Season with salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes. Stir and cook for approx 1&frac12; min on each side then remove and set aside.
1. Turn heat down to medium. Melt butter in pan, add shallot and garlic and sauté until shallot is softened and translucent, 2 minutes. 
1. Stir in the wine, scraping the bottom of pan to release any brown bits. Bring to simmer and cook for 2 minutes until slightly reduced. 
1. Add rice and stir for 30 seconds.
1. Stir in &frac23; of the chicken broth. Bring to a simmer and adjust heat to maintain a gently simmer. Simmer for 5 minutes. Stir, then simmer for a further 2 minutes until broth is mostly absorbed and rice is visible on the surface.
1. Add remaining broth and milk. Simmer for another 5 minutes stirring every minute. Risotto should be soupy and rice still not fully cooked through. 
1. Add Parmesan cheese and avocado then stir vigorously for 10 seconds. 
1. Stir in the shrimp and mushrooms, gently simmer until they are heated through and risotto is at your preferred consistency remembering it will thicken off the heat.
1. Serve immediately thinning out with hot broth or water as needed. Garnish with parmesan and parsley if desired.

### Recipe Notes

* Risotto should be made with risotto rice or Arborio rice because it’s extra starchy and this is what makes risotto beautifully creamy 
* Risotto consistency: everyone has their own preference. I usually take the risotto off the heat while it’s still soupier than you want on the plate (as shown in the video) because the rice continues to cook and absorb liquid. It should still be able to be poured out on to a plate when served although if you like yours thicker you can leave it on the heat a little longer until you have the consistency you like. 
* Leftovers & Storage: if your risotto isn’t over cooked and the rice is still al dente when it’s served it should hold up well when reheated. Leftovers can be stored in an airtight container in the fridge, then reheated in the microwave  or stovetop with a touch of water, milk or broth stirred through to loosen it up. The rice will be a bit softer than the first time it was served but still tasty.
