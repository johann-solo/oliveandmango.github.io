This simple rustic free form plum galette with an almond filling is the perfect way to enjoy plums. The plums bake up beautifully in this galette but really any seasonal fruit will work like strawberries, rhubarb, peaches, cherries, apricots or apples. The dough is buttery, flaky and very forgiving and it comes together in no time in a food processor.

I can never resist a tangy plum dessert. This buttery crust enveloped dessert can be served as a brunch cake or for dessert topped with vanilla ice cream or whipped cream.  The crust or dough is easy to make and recommended but you can use store-bought dough if you want. That is what I love about galettes - they are so versatile and also so forgiving. The more rustic they look the better.

The plums get naturally jammy in the galette. I normally do not peel them for pies and galettes. Especially for this galette where they are sliced and fanned out a bit; they give the finished dish a pretty look and color. The recipe calls for brushing plum or apricot preserves over the plums right out the oven to give them that gorgeous glazed look. This is completely optional and if you don’t have preserves to brush on I normally substitute with a little brush of honey.

The filing is simple and serves two purposes. The almond filling not only enhances the taste of the plums but it also prevents soggy pastry. The almond mixture helps to soak up the jammy juices from the plums. Don’t worry there is still bubbling juices happening just not enough to effect the texture of the crust. The goal is crispy on the outside and jammy on the inside. Feel free to flavour the filing with a hint of spice or even a little lemon or orange zest.

Plums are somewhat underrated but they shine in this tasty galette filled with soft and jammy plums. Delicious served warm with ice cream. They are one of those fruits that many people don’t particularly think of or love fresh but baked are totally irresistible. You will love them in this galette and also in my [German Plum Cake with Streusel](https://www.oliveandmango.com/german-plum-cake-with-streusel-pflaumenkuchen/). Enjoy them while they are at their best!

### Directions

1. Put the flour, butter and salt in a food processor and process for 5 seconds; the butter should still be in pieces. Add the ice water and process for 5 seconds longer, just until the dough comes together; the butter should still be visible.

1. Remove the dough from the processor and gather it into a ball wrap and refrigerate 20-30 min. 

1. Meanwhile, wipe bowl of food processor clean and add almonds, 3 tablespoons sugar, and 2 tablespoons flour; pulse until ground to a coarse meal.

1. On a floured surface, roll out dough to &frac14;-inch thickness. Transfer to a parchment-lined baking sheet; sprinkle almond mixture over dough. With a spatula, transfer plums to dough; press lightly to fan out, leaving a 2-inch border. Fold edge of dough over fruit. Refrigerate 20 minutes. 

1. Preheat the oven to 400°F.

1. Brush crust with egg wash ; sprinkle crust with 2 tablespoons sliced almond. Bake until crust is golden and underside is cooked through, about 50-60 minutes.
