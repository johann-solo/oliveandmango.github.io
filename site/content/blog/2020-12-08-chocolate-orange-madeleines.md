Tasty chocolate orange madeleines. These make for an exquisite dessert with minimal effort and can be made in just minutes.  A crisp exterior, with a soft and spongey interior – perfect alongside a cup of tea or coffee. The orange zest adds that punch of citrus flavour and the orange liqueur adds a nice subtle citrus undertone that I love. Feel free to leave it out if you don’t have any or swap it out for some freshly squeezed orange juice. Enjoy them as is or take these to the next level by dipping them into a rich chocolate glaze and sprinkle them with a touch of flaky salt or regular sea salt and extra orange zest.

### Why you will love this recipe 
- Very easy and quick to make. A bowl and whisk and mostly pantry ingredients. 
- No chill time needed. These guys get that famous bump/hump without chill time.
- Chocolatey goodness. Need I say more. The batter is made with cocoa powder and then these delicious little cakes are dipped in chocolate too.

### What you will need 
- A Madeleine pan - preferably a nonstick one. I have two one non stick and one not and I brush butter on both regardless. The worst is having your perfect madeleines stick to your pan.  If you don’t have a Madeleine pan these can easily be made in a muffin tin. 
- The rest is fairly basic: eggs, butter, flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, sugar, orange zest. The grand marnier or any orange liqueur is optional but a nice addition.

### Why chocolate and orange? 
I love chocolate and orange together. I always think of chocolate oranges that I would often receive as gifts at the office I worked at and loved. This brings those same flavours to life but in cakelet form. It’s not a new combo on the blog. You guys love my [chocolate orange cake](https://www.oliveandmango.com/chocolate-orange-cake/) so much and I know you will love these little beauties too.

I made these and shared them with my friends that are gluten free. This year has been a difficult one not being able to get together with friends as easily and freely but staying connected via zoom and baked good deliveries has helped. It’s always nice to share baked goods and this is a recipe that is definitely meant to be shared and enjoyed.  Perhaps a drop off and a zoom meet up after to enjoy and chat along with a warm cup of coffee, tea or hot chocolate.

### Directions

1. Preheat oven to 375°F 
2. In a bowl using either a whisk or a mixer beat together the eggs, sugar and salt until well combined. Whisk in the vanilla
3. Whisk in the flour, cocoa and baking powder. Then whisk in the melted and slightly cooled butter. Stir until just combined, a few lumps in the batter are totally fine. Do not over mix.
4. Finally stir in the the orange zest and grand marnier if using. Then spoon the batter into your buttered madeleine pan and bake for 8-10 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into the center of a cookie comes out clean. Allow to cool in the pan on a cooling rack for a few minutes before sliding the out of pan and onto rack or flipping them onto to it. Allow to cool. 
5. To make the ganache, melt chocolate in a double boiler over medium low heat. Dip each madeleine halfway into the chocolate, then set back on the wire rack. Sprinkle with flaky salt and orange zest, then allow chocolate to harden completely and enjoy. 
6. They are best eaten when still warm and fresh from the oven. You can keep them in an airtight container for 1-2 days.
