A moist and tender Pecan prune banana bread - with a pecan streusel and a honey yoghurt glaze.  I made this bread in partnership with Metro using their Irresistibles brand Premium Pitted Prunes. Prunes can be a tough sell I know but you won’t feel like that after having a slice of this bread. These Irresistibles brand pitted prunes are tender, sweet, and the perfect addition to baked goods.

Like any dried fruit, these prunes although plump already, benefit from being soaked. I soaked these in boiling water and baking soda which helped them become as tender as they can get, as plump as they can get and helps them maintain that nice tender texture when baked. In the short soaking time the prunes soak up all the water so there is no need for staining them, you just add them in to the batter along with any bit of syrupy liquid that comes from them.

The prunes add sweetness and a nice texture to the bread. I’m not a huge fan of dried fruit in my baked goods especially the dyed colorful fruit to be honest, but I’m never opposed to dates and prunes in them. They add a wonderful caramel flavor and add a nice texture to baked goods.  They are not only delicious but they are so good for your too! We all know how good they are for digestion and regularity but they are also a great source of phenols, which help to prevent oxygen damage to cells. Their soluble fibre does slow down absorption of glucose, stabilising blood-sugar levels and they are one of the best foods for vitamin K, vital for strong bones and blood clotting.

They are fabulous in this banana bread which has already been named the best banana bread ever by my family and a friend who devoured it. The streusel is completely optional as is the glaze but they do add a little extra to the bread. Although the bread can stand on its own, the streusel adds a buttery crunch. You will notice below that you par bake the bread before adding the streusel because if you add it right after spooning the batter into the pan - you will have to keep a close eye on it because the nuts especially, can burn and taste bitter if burned. You can just tent the whole bread with foil and remove the foil toward the end of the baking time to allow the top to brown fully if you don’t want to par bake. It’s totally up  to you. I prefer par- baking it and then adding the streusel during the last part of baking the bread.  You don’t have to worry about checking it after it’s on. It turns out beautifully with a very crumbly topping that is so irresistible.

The glaze is so delicious and the yoghurt adds a nice slight tang to the glaze which is so good  with the cake and the streusel. Both the glaze and the streusel are worth the extra steps to make and are fairly easy to make and add to the bread. I’m sure you all have a favorite banana bread recipe, maybe you have more than one like I do. This one is such a good one and I think you should definitely give it a go. Your tummy will enjoy it in all respects.
