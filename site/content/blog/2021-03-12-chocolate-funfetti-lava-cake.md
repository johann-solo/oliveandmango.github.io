### Directions
#### For The Cake

1. Preheat oven to 350°F. Liberally grease 13x18 rectangular baking sheet with cooking spray and line with parchment paper and set aside. 
1. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, salt, and granulated sugar until combined. Mix in the oil, vanilla, vinegar and room temperature coffee OR water and whisk together until a smooth batter comes together. Pour into the prepared pan.
1. Bake for 20-25 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool completely. Refrigerate or freeze for a few minutes after it’s room temperature to make it easier to slice. 

#### For Fudge Buttercream Frosting 
* Add all ingredients to a food processor and run for about 20 seconds until frosting comes together. Scrape down the bowl and run until smooth.

#### For The Ganache
* Place chocolate in medium bowl. Heat cream in a small saucepan over medium heat (or microwave) until just below simmering. Pour hot cream over chocolate, leave as is for 1 min then stir well until smooth and glossy, set aside to cool. 

#### To assemble cake
1. Once cake is cool, use a 5” round biscuit cutter or plate to help you trim out circles of cake. You should be able to get 3 full circles and a 4th made from two halves. Place the first one down on a rimmed plate. Spread 2-3 tablespoons of the frosting over cake, then place second cake layer over it pressing it down lightly then repeat with remaining cake layers. Finishing off with the buttercream.  
1. Wrap cake with acetate sheet that is at least 2 inches taller than the cake.  Tape off ends.  Check that there are no gaps between acetate and frosting on the top layer, adding more frosting as needed.
1. Pour ganache over frosting 
1. Add the sprinkles all over the top of the ganache 
1. Slowly and gently pull acetate sheet complete off the cake allowing ganache to drip down the cake. Slice and enjoy
