Summer BBQ’s aren’t the same without a potato salad.  I’m a fan of all of them from creamy to herby. There are two types that I make often and are my go-to potato salads. One of them is a crispy bacon creamy potato salad and the second is this Greek style potato salad.

This salad is a nice change to the heavier creamier potato salads out there. This potato salad has more of a fresh and tangy flavour with its fresh herbs and lemony dressing. My husband calls those the ‘Greek trinity’ of flavours: lemon, oregano and olive oil. I think our flavours expand further than that but those three are definitely staples in many dressings and recipes including this one.

This salad can be enjoyed warm or chilled and even better the day after when the potatoes have absorbed all the lemony herby flavours. I also love adding feta to mine and making a meal out of these potatoes. It’s a great potato salad to bring to a potluck or a picnic. It has no dairy or mayo so it can sit out a little longer without the threat of food poisoning. They are perfect for all to enjoy because they are gluten free and vegan.

## How to make Greek potato salad: 
This salad is so easy to whip up and is refreshingly delicious. Simply steam or boil the potatoes and then drain. In the meantime chop all your herbs and onions, squeeze in the lemon juice and once the potatoes are done add them right into the bowl with the herbs and lemon juice. Toss them well and then drizzle in the olive oil, sprinkle in the oregano and season with salt and pepper to taste. Toss to combine and serve warm or allow to chill until ready to serve. Easy as that but so very delicious. It’s very flexible and you can easily add more or less of the herbs or the lemon juice according to your taste.  I personally like mine lemony so feel free to reduce amount if that is not your thing.

### Recipe
Serves 4-6 as a side 
</br>

### Ingredients

* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">5-7 medium sized potatoes (approx 1.5 lbs) pealed and chopped in half and then quartered or slice in half if using </span>baby potatoes 
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 small bunch of chive or green parts of green onions (optional) </span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 small bunch of parsley (approx &frac14; cup) chopped </span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 small bunch of dill (approx 2 tbsp) chopped </span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">½ of a small onion sliced finely lengthwise or one shallot (can use this alone or chive alone or both- I like a little bit of both)</span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">½ a tsp of dry oregano (optional)</span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 tbsp of olive oil </span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Juice of 1 lemon or 2-3 tbsp of vinegar white or red wine vinegar (I always prefer lemon juice but it’s still delicious with the vinegar if you don’t have lemons) </span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Salt and pepper to taste</span>
</br>
</br>

### Directions
1. Place the potatoes in a large pot and fill with cold water until the potatoes are completely submerged. Bring water to boil and salt the water very generously – simmer until fork tender. Alternatively you can steam the potatoes until fork tender.
2. While potatoes are boiling/steaming chop up all your fresh herbs and onions and place in a bowl along with your lemon juice or vinegar.
3. Once potatoes are ready, drain and place right into the bowl with the herbs. Delicately mix well and start drizzling in your olive oil.
4. Add your oregano and salt and pepper to taste
5. Serve and enjoy warm or let cool and serve cold. Either way they are delicious.

### Recipe notes
This recipe is flexible. Feel free to reduce or increase the amount of herbs or onions that you use along with how lemony you like them. I also love adding capers to mine for extra briny flavour and I have been known to toss in some feta. Enjoy!
