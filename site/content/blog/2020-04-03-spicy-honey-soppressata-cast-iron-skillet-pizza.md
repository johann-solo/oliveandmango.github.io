This skillet pizza is the way to go for a delicious crispy crust and for a quick bake up - thanks to a sizzling hot pan that gives this pizza a baking head start.

## How to make cast-iron skillet pizza 
First you need a good heavy bottom skillet 9-12" cast-iron is totally fine. Any size pan is really fine, but just remember the smaller the pan, the thicker the crust will be and the longer it may need to bake. If deep dish-style pizza is your thing, go for the 9".  If you want a crispier crust, use a larger pan. You want to preheat the pan so it's hot but not smoking (just watch your hands—and don't grab the handle without oven mitts) that is why the pan is preheated in the oven. This kicks start the baking process. Drizzle the hot pan with some olive oil set the dough snugly in the pan (again, watch your fingers). Pull the sides of the dough up the sides of the pan so it doesn't slump back down, being sure to distribute the dough evenly. Brush the top of the dough with olive oil. Then pile on your toppings and carefully put it in the oven to bake off for another 12-15 minutes and done! It’s that easy.

This is one of my favorite flavour combos when it comes to pizza. I’m definitely a pepperoni and cheese kind of girl and love a little heat. The addition of honey is so genius - I got the idea from a local pizza place and knew I needed to add it to the toppings list for the next pizza night. The sweet, salty, and spicy flavours go so well together. If you aren’t a fan of the heat just use regular salami - I promise you will be addicted to the sweet and savoury combo!!

This pizza comes together super fast if you have store-bought pizza dough on hand or if you have premade pizza dough.  I have my favorite pizza dough recipe below that I love to make on Friday night in preparation for pizza night Saturday. It only needs 1-1 1/2 hours to rest but I like to make it a day ahead. It’s easy but requires a little bit of elbow grease. It’s worth it and I always find kneading super therapeutic! It’s like an end of the week therapy session when I’m making my pizza dough. Using store bought is totally acceptable though and even quicker so feel free to use whatever you like.

The same goes for the pizza sauce - store bought is totally fine but I have also included my go-to recipe for a super delicious thick and rich pizza sauce. It’s super easy to make and lasts in the fridge for at least a week so it’s easy to make ahead. Homemade always tastes better to me, but when it comes to getting dinner on the table fast I’m definitely not above a good store bought cheat.

## How To Make The Perfect Homemade Pizza Dough
Makes one large pizza or two small/medium 10-12 inch sized ones (approx 1-1 &frac12; lbs dough) 
</br> 
</br>

### Ingredients

* 2 tsp active dry yeast
* 1 tbsp honey
* 1 cup plus 5 tbsp of lukewarm water
* 1½ cups all purpose flour - plus more for dusting
* 1½ cups bread flour or “OO” flour (sub with AP flour)
* 2 tbsp olive oil
* 1 tsp salt

### Directions
1. In a large bowl combine the yeast, honey, and water and stir well. Set aside for about 10 minutes to allow the yeast to activate and bubble up.
2. Add the flours, olive oil, and salt to the bowl and stir with a wooden spoon until a mass of dough begins to form. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and put your timer on for ten minutes and start kneading.
3. Transfer the dough to a bowl that has been lightly greased and cover with plastic wrap. Place in a warm spot and let the dough rise and double in size for approx 1 ½ hours. If you’re making ahead wrap and place in the fridge to rise overnight. The next day when you plan to use it warm it on the countertop for approx ½ hour -45 min before using.
4. Once ready to use, punch down the dough and transfer to a floured surface. Cut the dough in half and shape both into balls if making two small pizzas, if making one larger one, leave as is 
5. Preparing one at a time, roll the dough out with a rolling pin stretching it out as needed and transfer to pizza stone, sheet pan or cast iron skillet
