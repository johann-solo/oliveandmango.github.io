excerpt: Soft, chewy and deep in colour and flavour

When it comes to cookies I’m a simple gal and very happy with a good chocolate chip/chunk one. Not that I don’t eat others but usually if there’s a selection those will be the ones I choose. I thought I should widen out when it comes to cookies so I started experimenting with ginger bread cookies. I do enjoy them too and I love the slight burn or sensation that ginger leaves behind, but I wanted a cookie that would be softer and chewier than a ginger snap. The reason being that I wanted to use them to make ice cream sandwiches with my chestnut ice cream (recipe here for that chestnut ice cream).

These were perfect for ice-cream sandwiches and otherwise.  They are so soft and chewy and dense enough to hold up in a cookie sandwich. The recipe makes large sized cookies perfect for ice cream sandwiches, but if you’re not using them in a sandwich you can change the cookie ball size to 1 inch instead of two as the recipe calls for, to get a smaller sized cookie.

Why did I decide to use ginger spiced molasses cookies as the base to my ice cream sandwiches with my chestnut ice cream? I’m no flavour genius but I’m slowly learning about which flavours work together and which don’t. Plus I recall foods I have tried and loved in the past. Growing up with Italians - the food and people are very near and dear to my heart - I appreciated new foods and textures and flavours and I’m so grateful for that. There were many baby showers and weddings I attended and Italian cookies were always a feature and they always intrigued and delighted me.

I am not a sweets person at all but I do like to have a bite or two of dessert and if I see a unique cookie or cake, I need to try!! One of those cookies that I needed to try at one of those events (among many others) was tortelli cookies which are a pastry filled cookie.  The filling is made up of creamy chocolate chestnut purée. The purée is a little boozy from rum and also spiced. I later learned it that it’s spiced with ginger, clove and cinnamon. They are so addictive!

When I decided to make the chestnut ice cream, the memory of those chestnut cookies came right back and I thought of how well the ice cream would go with a spiced cookie. That is how I came about making these beauties.

I did say that these cookies are perfect in ice cream sandwiches and OTHERWISE and I meant it. There were several leftover cookies after making the sandwiches and I devoured all of them. They are totally addictive. I found myself going back for more every time I passed the kitchen.  They had no chance of survival!  Super easy to whip up, soft, chewy, spiced, rich flavour and dark in colour from the molasses, with a very slight hint of rum. I added the rum more to intensify the rest of the flavours not so much the boozy factor. That’s what I love about adding rum to baked goods.  Unless you drench them, you get not so much boozy but an extra punch of flavour and a subtle hint of rum. The perfect combination for a ginger spiced cookie, at least in my books. You won’t be disappointed and baking them makes the kitchen smell irresistibly fragrant. Enjoy!
