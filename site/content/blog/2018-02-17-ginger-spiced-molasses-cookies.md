These ginger spiced molasses cookies are delightfully chewy with a crisp sugar coated exterior and plenty of spice and warmth, they are impossible to resist. They have the perfect balance of sweet molasses, spicy ginger, and warm cinnamon. They have become one of my favourite cookie - and this simple recipe for them will get you on team ginger molasses cookie as well.
I have always been team chocolate chunk but I thought I should widen out when it comes to cookies so I started experimenting with ginger cookies. This recipe is the result of doing so. Homemade ginger molasses cookies are so much better than any store bought molasses cookie out there and worth investing in a box or tin of molasses - you will be making batches and batches of these.

Homemade soft molasses cookies with crackly tops are super chewy and so perfectly spiced. They stay seriously soft for days – if they last that long. I loved using some of mine to make ice cream sandwiches with my [chestnut ice cream](https://www.oliveandmango.com/no-churn-roasted-chestnut-ice-cream/). Sounds like a weird combo - well I was inspired by an Italian chestnut cookie called tortelli that I love. They have a chestnut spiced filling with ginger, clove and cinnamon - similar spices found in these cookies. They cookies are so soft and chewy and dense enough to hold up in a cookie sandwich.

These cookies are seriously addictive. I found myself going back for more every time I passed the kitchen. They had no chance of survival! Super easy to whip up, soft, chewy, spiced, rich flavour and dark in colour from the molasses, with a very slight hint of rum. I added the rum more to intensify the rest of the flavours not so much the boozy factor. That’s what I love about adding rum to baked goods. Unless you drench them, you get not so much boozy but an extra punch of flavour and a subtle hint of rum. The perfect combination for a ginger spiced cookie, at least in my books. You won’t be disappointed and baking them makes the kitchen smell irresistibly fragrant. So I hope that you enjoy them as much as we do, and if you decide to bake up a batch, I’d love to hear how they go!

</br>

### Ingredients

* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2½ cups all-purpose flour</span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2¼ teaspoons baking soda</span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">½ teaspoon salt</span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tablespoon ground ginger</span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1½ tsp ground cinnamon</span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">½ tsp ground clove</span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">¼teaspoon ground allspice</span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">½ teaspoon ground pepper</span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">¾ cup (1½ sticks) unsalted butter, room temperature</span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">½ cup packed light-brown sugar</span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">½ cup granulated sugar, plus ⅓ cup for coating</span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">6 tablespoons molasses</span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tbsp dark rum</span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 large egg</span>

### Directions

1. In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, baking soda, salt, ginger, allspice, and pepper.
1. Cream the butter, brown sugar, and ½ cup granulated sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in molasses, egg and rum. With mixer on low, gradually beat in flour mixture until just combined. Wrap bowl in  plastic, and freeze for 20 minutes or refrigerate 1 hour or up to 2-3 days. Meanwhile preheat oven to 350°F and line two baking sheets with parchment paper; set aside.
1. Remove cookie dough from the refrigerator. If the cookie dough chilled longer than 2 hours, let it sit at room temperature for at least 30 minutes. Place remaining ⅓ cup granulated sugar in a bowl. Roll cookie dough, 1 Tablespoon each, into balls. Roll each in granulated sugar and arrange 3 inches apart on the baking sheets. Bake for 11-12 minutes or until edges appear set. If the tops aren’t appearing cracked as pictured, remove the baking sheet from the oven and gently bang it on the counter 2-3x. This will help those warm cookies spread out and crack on top. Return to the oven for 1 additional minute.
1. Remove from the oven and allow cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.
1. Cookies will stay fresh covered at room temperature for 1 week.

### Recipe note

* Chilling the cookie dough is always a good idea to allow the flavours and textures  to develop. If you skip the chill time they will still be delicious but the dough will spread out more when baked and the cookies will be thinner.
