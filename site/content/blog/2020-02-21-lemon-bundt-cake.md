This lemon bundt cake is deliciously moist and has just the right amount of lemony flavour in it. We all need a good no fail lemon bundt cake in our lives - especially a simple uncomplicated one that turns out perfectly every time. This is that bundt cake for me. It’s one of my favourites that I have been making for a long while originally by Martha Stewart. I reduced the sugar by a bit from the original recipe and I also added a glaze and icing to mine - the glaze might be a bit extra which I love but I think the glaze is a must. A drizzle of homemade lemon syrup over this cake puts it over the top. It gives the edges, which can dry out quickly, moisture and flavour so. Strongly recommend it.

## A gluten free bundt cake made with paleo flour
I decided that this was the recipe I would try Bob’s Red Mill Paleo Baking flour on for <span class="highlight"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.bobsredmill.com/?utm_source=TheOliveAndMango&utm_medium=influencer&utm_campaign=bobsredmill">Bob’s Red Mill</a></span> #grainfreebaking campaign with <span class="highlight"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/">Whole Foods</a></span>. The reason why I chose this cake was not only because it’s a beloved one and I have been wanting to share it on the blog for a while now, but also because I was super confident that the blend of flours in the Paleo Baking flour would work really well with it. I had a strong suspicion that this cake would taste a lot like my revani [Greek semolina cake](https://www.oliveandmango.com/greek-semolina-cake-revani/). I was totally right - it has the same moistness as it and I love how well this cake really soaks in the glaze. I have made this own try of times with regular all purpose flour and it’s absolutely perfect either way!

## A delicious grain-free dessert
<span class="highlight"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.bobsredmill.com/paleo-baking-flour.html">Bob’s Red Mill Paleo Baking Flour</a></span> takes the guesswork out of grain-free baking. It’s a simple blend of almond, coconut, and tapioca flour. This simple flour blend makes it easy to create delicious baked goods like cakes, cookies, muffins, paleo pancakes, flatbreads, crackers and so much more. I wasn’t too sure if I would like it as an alternative/substitute to all purpose flour but I did. It makes for a bit of a denser cake as expected when you are baking with almond flour. So far I love using it just as much as I love using their Gluten Free 1-1 flour as a flour replacement and I foresee some waffles in the near future using this blend. Bob’s has you covered when it comes to all baking needs - Grain/Gluten Free, vegan or paleo - grab them on line or in store at wholefoods.

This cake is made with freshly squeezed lemon juice and lemon zest for maximum lemon flavours in it. It’s a cake for all ocassion and especially during citrus season when the lemons are extra fresh and in abundance! It requires super basic pantry staples making it so simple to make and you can use whatever shape bundt pan you would like. Just make sure you grease your pan well - with butter or even baking spray - I mean every nook and cranny and your cake will come out of the pan flawlessly. Hope you love this one just as much as I do!

* <span itemprop="ingredients">2 tbsps finely grated lemon zest</span>

### Directions
1. Preheat oven to 350°F and prep your pan. Grease a 12-cup Bundt pan very well and set aside.
2. In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, lemon zest, baking soda, and salt and set aside.
3. In a large bowl using an electric hand or standing mixer, beat butter and sugar on medium-high until light and fluffy, 4 to 5 minutes. Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition then add the vanilla and lemon juice.
4. With mixer on low, add flour mixture and yoghurt alternating between each, beginning and ending with flour mixture; mix just until incorporated (do not overmix). Spoon batter into prepared pan and smooth top with a rubber spatula. Firmly tap pan on a work surface several times to level batter.
5. Bake until a toothpick inserted in center of cake comes out clean; 50-60 minutes and if the cake browns too quickly, tent loosely with aluminium foil.
6. The Lemon Glaze: While the cake is baking, make the lemon glaze. In a small microwave-safe bowl (or saucepan) whisk together the sugar and lemon juice. Microwave (or on the stovetop- cook until dissolved) for 20-30 seconds, whisking halfway through, until the sugar is completely dissolved and then set aside.
7. The Lemon Icing: Sift the powdered sugar into a medium bowl. Add the lemon juice and whisk until smooth. Adding a touch more lemon juice as needed to get to to the consistency you want.
8. After the cake is done baking, let cool in the pan for 10 minutes, cut away any uneven pieces if needed, then invert onto a wire rack set over a baking sheet and remove the bundt pan.
9. Brush the cake lightly with the lemon glaze. Let cool completely, at least 1 hour.
10. Pour the icing over the top of the cake, letting it drip down the sides. Grate lemon zest over the icing. Let the glaze dry completely then transfer to a platter, slice and serve. Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days. Then refrigerate for up to 4-5 days more.

### Recipe Notes

* The Paleo flour is a 1-1 substitute for all purpose flour so you can use all purpose flour in its place.
* Greek yoghurt can be substituted for sour cream in the recipe
* Freezing Instructions: Wrap unglazed baked and cooled cake in a couple of layers of plastic wrap, then a layer of aluminium foil. Freeze for up to 3 months. Allow to thaw in the plastic wrap & foil overnight in the refrigerator, then bring to room temperature before glazing, slicing, and serving.
* Loaf Pan: this bundt cake can also be baked into 2 loaf pans. Pour the batter into two greased 9×5 inch loaf pans. Bake each at 350°F for approx 45 minutes or until baked through. Use toothpick to test for doneness.
