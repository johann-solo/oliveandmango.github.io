These Nutella Cupcakes are rich and delicious homemade chocolate hazelnut cupcakes topped with creamy Nutella frosting. They are always a hit. They not only have hazelnut spread in the batter but are also filled and frosted with nutella frosting. For those Nutella fans out there (aka my peeps) this is the cupcake recipe for you. They are so easy to make, perfectly moist, chocolatey cupcakes that are bursting with delicious hazelnut and chocolate flavors. They have been a long time coming on the blog. They are a beloved recipe that has been on my list to add to the blog and finally they have landed! They are perfectly moist and the frosting is made of two ingredients and totally to die for! If you are crazy about Nutella or any hazelnut spread even if you make your own hazelnut spread (good for you btw) you will adore these.

It’s been 2 whole months since we have come back to Canada from living in Trinidad for the last 6 years and the transition has been slow in some ways and very fast in other ways. I started working at a dental office a few days after we landed and blog life has continued pretty seamlessly as I worked my butt off trying to get extra content prepped for guys before I left Trinidad knowing that there would be a transitional period over here with zero props and backgrounds (utensils and anything for that matter). Am I settled? Not really - or fully but slowly getting there. I’m pretty adaptable so things have been interesting at times - and I have had to find the humour in things especially when shooting.

Ok why the long explanation - well the transition back to these cupcakes is this: since I’m back in Canada I have a little more access to certain ingredients and flours (like GF ones) to experiment with. So I started by experimenting with all purpose gluten free flours and found one that didn’t require the addition of xanthum gum or anything else - it’s 100 percent 1:1 all purpose Gluten free flour. It was simple to use and the result was delicious! People couldn’t tell the difference unless they knew one was GF between the two when I made both GF and non GF. I was very happy using the flour and was so pleased it was so transitional. I have yet to experiment with blending GF flours but baby steps right?

That being said, these cupcakes can be made with regular all purpose flour or your choice of GF all purpose flour that is 1:1 unless you are a master GF baker and know your ratios of blending xanthum and other ingredients. They turn predictably perfect every time and they are always a hit for a party, bbq (where I tested them on two occasions among two groups of friends) or any excuse you want for making cupcakes. They whip up pretty quickly and are quite easy to make.

To fill them all I used was a thin piping attachment and literally placed it into the cupcakes and piped as much as it would allow for. You will know when it’s full. The filling will start to overflow. The other alternative is to use one of those cupcake centre poppers which I use to have but left it behind in Trinidad. You can also use a knife to cut out a portion of it as directed below. Either option works well I just piped it in without removing any bit of the cupcake for ease and speed.

You can use any hazelnut spread you would like and you can also substitute the cream cheese with mascarpone for an even richer frosting. Just make sure if you use mascarpone, allow it to come to room temperature before mixing and do not over mix it so that it’s stays smooth and creamy. Cream cheese is a delicious option that I usually choose cause I almost always have it on hand and is more budget friendly if that is a concern. Both give you a luscious that according to my husband - is to die for. He likes to pipe it straight into his mouth and must lick the bowl. These really are a sweet treat and you will just have to try them yourself to see what I mean.

* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">½ teaspoon baking soda</span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">¼ teaspoon salt</span>

__For the filling__

* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">One 250 gram package of cream cheese softened at room temperature </span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">¾ cup or 250 g hazelnut spread plus up to a ¼ more if you want it a little more chocolatey</span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 teaspoon vanilla extract</span>
</br>
</br>

### Directions

__For the cupcakes__

1. Preheat oven to 320°F and line the cupcake tin with cupcake liners
1. In a medium size bowl whisk together the flour, baking soda and salt and set aside.
1. In a large bowl, whisk together the the hazelnut spread and boiling water until the Nutella melts and is completely incorporated.
1. Then whisk in the cocoa powder and instant coffee until the coffee is dissolved.
1. Whisk in the heavy cream, coconut oil, eggs and vanilla extract until all of the ingredients are completely combined.
1. Add the sugar and whisk until it dissolves completely.
1. Mix in the dry ingredients into the wet until fully incorporated.
1. Transfer into a large measuring cup or bowl with a pouring lip or use a ladle to fill the cupcake molds by pouring the mixture ⅔ of the way.
1. Bake for 18-24 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Allow to cool 10 minutes in the cupcake tin then transfer to a wire rack to cool. Cool completely before stuffing and frosting*

__For the filling and frosting__

1. In a large bowl whisk or mix (with a mixer) the cream cheese and hazelnut spread, and vanilla extract until completely smooth and combined.
1. Transfer to a piping bag and refrigerate for approx 20 minutes for the filling to become thicker and firmer and easier to pipe

__To assemble__

1. Pipe the filling into the cupcakes with a thin piping tip and pipe the frosting right into the cupcake by placing the tip halfway through the cupcake pulling the tip out slightly as you pipe. You will know it’s filled when the cupcake starts to actually expand a little and filling starts to overflow on the top. Then frost the cupcakes as desired
1. Alternatively – cut off the top part of the cupcakes or the centre portion of it all around at a 45 degree angle with a knife and remove the cone shaped part you created and snack on them or discard.
1. Pipe the filling into all of the cupcakes and then frost the tops of the cupcakes as desired.
Serve immediately. Store leftover cupcakes in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.

### Recipe Notes
* There is a moderate amount of Nutella frosting for these cupcakes but if you love loads of extra frosting on yours then feel free to double recipe amount for it.
* Always check to see if cupcakes are done as soon as they reach the minimum baking time. The easiest way to test is by inserting a toothpick during baking. If it comes out clean or with just a few dry crumbs attached, your cupcake is done! Each oven is different, so it’s always good to check a few minutes earlier then required.
* Make Ahead & Freezing Instructions: Plain cupcakes can be made ahead 1 day in advance, covered and stored in the refrigerator overnight. Frosting can also be made 1 day in advance, covered, and stored in the refrigerator until ready to use. Bring cupcakes to room temperature before frosting. Freeze unfrosted cupcakes for up to 2-3 months. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator.
