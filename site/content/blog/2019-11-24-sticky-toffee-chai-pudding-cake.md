This is a delicious bundt version of this classic and decadent dessert. This is definitely a dessert that reminds me of winter time. It’s best served slightly warm, sauce included and enjoyed alongside something warm to drink. The perfect wintertime treat when you are craving caramel’ly comfort. It’s sweet and decadent and perfectly spiced and you truly can’t beat a dessert that is dowsed in a rich caramel sauce.  I made this bundt in partnership with Metro, the local grocery store that I depend on almost daily. It’s always got what I need and everything I used in this cake can be found at Metro.

The cake gets a good brush of caramel sauce as soon as it’s flipped out of the bundt pan while it’s still hot so that it absorbs that delicious flavour plus it keeps the cake super moist. The dates get soaked in tea for a boost in flavour and a boost in moisture also. The original recipe I went off of to make this cake is from Jamie Oliver - his recipe is fabulous by the way as is - he uses Earl Grey tea to soak the dates in but I wanted to do a chai spice version of it so I used chia tea. I also used chai flavours in the cake to boost those flavours even further. The dates soak and then get puréed with the spices. It’s so tasty and it not only adds flavour to the batter base but also adds to the texture of it.  It also makes this cake moist and fabulous.

I love that the recipe calls for self rising flour - that shortens the ingredients list further and simplifies the recipe. If you don’t have self rising flour though check out this simple alternative [homemade self rising flour](https://www.oliveandmango.com/maple-pecan-cinnamon-rolls/). Another time saver is using a store-bought caramel sauce. I used <span class="highlight"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.metro.ca/en/online-grocery/aisles/pantry/cereals-spreads-syrups/chocolate-sweet-spreads/dulce-de-leche-caramel-spread/p/059749903684">Irresistibles brand Dulce De Leche caramel spread</a></span> which worked wonderfully. I just heated it up to make it pourable and so that i could brush it onto the cake. If you are feeling adventurous feel free to make it at home - I have the homemade recipe included below.

It takes no time to whip this cake up - the steeping and soaking of the tea and the dates takes a few extra minutes but it’s worth the wait and extra step. The dates are what make this classic a classic along with the toffee/caramel sauce whether you use a storebought one or a make a homemade one. You’re gonna love this one as much as we did I just know it!! I can’t wait for you to make it!! Enjoy!

__For the homemade caramel sauce__

* <span itemprop="ingredients">1 cup + 1 tbsp unsalted butter</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">&frac23; cup muscovado or dark brown sugar </span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">&frac34; cup granulated sugar </span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">3 tbsp dark rum</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">1&frac14; cups heavy cream </span>

### Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Put the tea bags into a measuring cup, cover with 1&frac14; cups of boiling water, and leave to steep for 3&frac12; minutes. Meanwhile, place dates into a food processor with all the spices. Scoop out the tea bags and pour the tea over the dates, pushing them down so they are submerged. Leave them in the processor to soak with the lid on for 10 minutes, then process into a puree, stopping occasionally to scrape down the sides. 
1. Butter and lightly flour a 10-inch bundt pan. In a large bowl, cream the butter and sugars together with a mixer. Then beat in the eggs, one by one, followed by the vanilla extract. Add in the flour and mix just until incorporated. Then fold in the pureed dates until batter is close to uniform in colour (it’s ok if there are still some lighter streaks in the batter). Pour the mixture into your bundt pan or baking dish, then bake for 45 to 50 minutes, or until an inserted skewer comes out clean.
1. When the cake is almost ready, warm the Irresistibles caramel sauce in a small sauce pan or in the microwave. You just want it warm enough to pour easily. 
1. (If you are making the caramel sauce from scratch: Cube the butter and melt in a small saucepan on a medium heat. Add both the sugars, then, once nicely mixed, carefully add the rum (it may splatter) and heavy cream. Bring to a boil, then simmer for around 5 minutes, or until a lovely deep golden colour. Let cool for 5 minutes, brush the cake with a thing layer of it and then fold in pecans or if you prefer them out of the sauce leave them out and sprinkle them on the cake separately. )
1. As soon as the cake is ready, remove from oven and allow to sit in bundt pan for 15 minutes on a cooling rack and then flip out onto a platter and brush all over with a thin layer of the caramel sauce.  Because the cake is still quite hot it will absorb a lot of it. 
1. Sprinkle with the pecans and a little sea salt and serve with more sauce and a little whip cream, or ice cream. Can be served still warm or at room temperature.
