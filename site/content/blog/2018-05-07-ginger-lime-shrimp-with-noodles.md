I love the intense flavour of ginger and it together with lime make a flavour combination that goes so well in so many things. From sweet to savoury dishes and even to cocktails.

I love this recipe and it’s on repeat in our home a lot. It’s quick and easy and is super versatile. You can make it with any meat you would like, remembering that other meats may require more time to cook though. That is the great thing about using shrimp. They cook so quickly making meal prep almost enjoyable.

You can totally switch up the veggies in the meal as well. I love to add mushrooms and crunchy water chestnuts too. You can do it all veggies alone, which is also a great option.

We love the taste and texture of soba noodles and we tend to use those more frequently but you can use any noodle you like. One benefit of using soba noodles is that they cook up in just a couple minutes making them ideal for quick dinner prep which I love.

When it comes to flavoring things nothing beats a good marinade. I would definitely not skip this step. This step gives the shrimp and the whole dish so much flavour. I usually make the marinade and stick my shrimp in it the night before and that way meal prep is even simpler.

Basically you see a very clear theme in this dish - simple, quick, easy meal prep. What more could I want especially for a midweek meal. Our leftovers make it for lunch the next day. If I’m home I like to reheat them in a skillet with a little more sesame oil and soy sauce! They are just as delicious the next day! This is a great recipe and a staple one in our home. It’s one we love to switch up and add different things to according to what is in the fridge at the time. If you like ginger and lime as much as I do you will love this quick and easy meal!

### Ingredients 

__For the marinade__

* 1 pound raw shrimp, peeled and deviened (I like to leave the tails on but that is optional)
* 2 tablespoons olive oil
* 1 clove garlic minced or grated
* &frac12; teaspoon freshly grated ginger
* &frac12; tablespoon lime zest
* 1 tablespoon lime juice
* &frac12; tablespoon soy sauce
* &frac12; tsp chili flakes (optional)

__For the dish__

* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* 1 red pepper, thinly sliced
* 1 cup of chopped broccoli
* 2 cloves of garlic minced
* &frac12; inch of ginger peeled and grated
* 1 cup sugar snap peas tough stringy part trimmed or peeled back 
* 1 tablespoon soy sauce
* 1 tsp sesame oil
* 1 tsp of fish sauce (optional)
* &frac12; pound of soba noodles or noodles of your preference
* Salt and pepper to taste

__Garnishes (all optional but definitely recommended)__

* 2 tablespoons peanuts, crushed
* Sliced green onions
* Sesame seeds
* Lime wedges to serve with for an extra squeeze of lime juice
* Freshly chopped veggies of choice like crunchy radishes and cabbage
* Extra soya sauce to taste for drizzling

### Directions

1. Whisk together all the marinade ingredients in a bowl and either toss the shrimp in to coat and cover and refrigerate or place the shrimp and marinade in a ziplock bag marinate for 2-24 hours.

1. Bring pasta water to a boil and cook according to package directions, draining and setting aside until later. If using soba noodles I like to cook them al dente and then when they are rinsed and drained I will toss them in a bit of sesame oil to help prevent them from sticking but that is optional. Set them aside until you are ready to add them to the pan with the rest of the ingredients.

1. Once ready to cook, heat a skillet on medium heat and add olive oil. 

1. Add peppers and the broccoli to the pan and saute until soft, about 6-8 minutes. 

1. Add garlic and and stir for 30 seconds. 

1. Add shrimp to pan and cook on each side for about 2-3 minutes until cooked though. 

1. Add snap peas and pasta along with the sesame oil and fish sauce if you are using thoroughly stirring until everything is coated and combined. Season with salt and pepper if desire and serve with all the garnishes.
