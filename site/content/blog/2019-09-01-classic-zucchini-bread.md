This zucchini bread is my all time favourite. It’s no fuss, straightforward, all you need is bowl and spatula, basic pantry ingredients and totally adaptable if you want to add various flavours, flours, spices etc. It tastes like mom's baking and is such a simple bread to whip up in no time and also a great way to use up extra zucchini.

I have tried many recipes for zucchini bread and they all claim to be the best - I actually seriously don’t understand that statement - especially when it comes to quick breads, cookies and other baked goods that I know everyone has different tastes in. So I’m not making that claim at all but it is my favourite recipe and it’s from Alexandracooks.com. Her recipe is so darn good. It’s the best in my books, meaning according to my taste when it comes to a quick bread, as I like a moist no-fuss bread that I can whip up easily and I know will come out the same every time. Consistently delicious. This is definitely one of those recipes. If we have the same taste in a quick bread than I know you will love it too!

All I did differently was add a little more spice and also I love my quick breads with nuts and chocolate in them, so I added walnuts and chocolate chunks. You can make your bread without these and it would be just fine - I just love that extra bit of texture those two add to a quick bread.

I’m pretty sure you have some zucchini laying around - probably a little too sad to make my [Zucchini Salad](https://www.oliveandmango.com/shaved-zucchini-salad-with-a-lemony-vinaigrette/) but definitely good enough to make this zucchini bread. I just bought a few more fresh ones for a recipe I’m making tomorrow that I’m very excited about and I bought just enough for the recipe and a little extra to make another loaf. I can’t wait! If you get a chance make this zucchini bread - you won’t regret it!
