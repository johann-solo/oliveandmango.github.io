This is not only a versatile dressing but it’s also customizable. I love to use any fresh herbs I have on hand and if I don’t have fresh chives or green onions I often grate in a clove of garlic. It’s an easy one to whip up and it even tastes better the next day making it a great make ahead dressing that you can keep on hand in the fridge. It keeps well in the fridge for up to 3 days. We go through it quicker that that cause it’s really that good. I recommend using a full fat greek yoghurt for the base as this adds to the creamier texture of the dressing.  I love using avocado mayo but any mayo would work well here.  I know you will love it and will want to slather it on just about it anything. Enjoy!
