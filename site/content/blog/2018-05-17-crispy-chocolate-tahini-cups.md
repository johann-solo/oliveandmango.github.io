excerpt: Fancy little cups of chocolate goodness

Tahini has become the new "it" food and so it should be! It has always been part of my hummus and really and truly it has a special place in my heart. Anything sesame seed related reminds me of my father. One of his favorite snacks to eat are sesame snaps. When I was a kid I absolutely hated them. He thought they were the best thing ever made and anytime we were out he would pick some up and offer them to us expecting us to react the same way as he would to them. We didn’t of course, cause that was definitely not my idea of a great snack nor was it my brother's.

Well I’m older now, have more mature taste buds and I quite love them and anything sesame related. It could be that or I’m drawn to them cause I love my dad so much and miss him and they remind me of him. Whatever the case I’m a fan now. Going to quickly change over to talking about these yummy tahini cups before I get overly verklempt. I definitely had my dad in mind with these babies and also my mother in law who is vegan.  Unfortunately when I made them I didn’t have dark chocolate on hand so my first version wasn’t technically vegan cause I used semi sweet chocolate, so when she was visiting I couldn’t offer them to her. Next time I will have my dark chocolate and rock her world with these babies!

The tahini is super prominent in these, so a warning if you’re not a fan. You can use peanut butter or even almond butter as a substitute though if you prefer.  I had a huge vat of tahini to go through, which is another reason I decided to make these.  I am so happy I did.

The tahini is sweetened by maple syrup and the addition of cardamom works so well with the tahini and adds a beautiful warm flavour to it and everything it touches. I absolutely love it and knew I had to add some to the mix.

Adding the puffed brown rice was a no brainer because these were basically modeled after rice crispy squares, which I love by the way. They add the crispy crunch factor that these cups need.

The _pièce de résistance_ is the chocolate layer over the crispy tahini layer. Isn’t the chocolate layer on anything really the most important part? To me it is and truly the perfect cap to these delicious little cups.  To cap the cap off and to be a little fancy, I added the dried rose petals over the chocolate which went perfect with the flavours in these cups along with some pink salt.  I’m not fancy every day though, so a simple sprinkle of sesame seeds is also fabulous!

You will love these pretty little things and do hope you give them a try! Those of you who don’t fully appreciate tahini may be converted after tasting them. Enjoy!

### Ingredients 

* ¾ cup tahini (pure ground sesame seed paste) 
* 2 tablespoons maple syrup plus more to desired sweetness 
* &frac12; tsp of vanilla extract 
* &frac12; tsp of cardamom 
* ¼ cup coconut oil
* ¾ cup crispy brown rice cereal 
* ½ cup (3 oz.) dark chocolate (vegan chocolate) 
* Garnish with sea salt and dried rose petals or sesame seeds 

### Directions 

1. Line a muffin tin with 12 muffin liners and set aside (you can also use silicon molds)
1. In a small saucepan on low heat, combine the tahini, maple syrup, and coconut oil and stir occasionally until its completely smooth. Remove from heat when smooth and stir in the cardamom and vanilla extract. 
1. Stir in the crispy brown rice cereal and divide the mixture between the 12 liners, which should be about a &frac13; full in a regular sized muffin tin pan 
1. Place in the refrigerator or freezer to firm up for about 10-30 minutes (I always use the freezer if there’s room) 
1. Once it’s firm, melt your dark chocolate  on the stove top on low heat in a small sauce pan. 
1. Cover each tahini  cup with melted chocolate and garnish with sea salt and dried rose petals or sesame seeds.
1. Return to the fridge or freezer to firm up completely.
1. Keep stored in the fridge or freezer until serving. They will soften up and melt at room temperature so I like to serve them right out of the fridge.
