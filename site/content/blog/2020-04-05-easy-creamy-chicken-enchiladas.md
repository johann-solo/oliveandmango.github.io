These enchiladas are creamy, cheesy and loaded with a delicious filling. They also pack a good amount of veggies in them too. Just enough to trick your brain into thinking it’s totally fine to eat half the baking dish on your own. True story! They are great with the meat in them but feel free to switch up the filling to something vegetarian. More details about what to add in as a meat replacement below. They are so good and one of the most requested potluck dishes I make.

They are super simple to make and require pretty basic ingredients found in the freezer or your pantry. Just like a lasagna they are a great make ahead meal and they freeze well too. All the details below on how to do that. They are great for making ahead for your family making your week easier and especially great if you are having company over. I always make them the night before which makes entertaining less stressful. You just have to pop them in the oven just before dinner time. Less time fussing in the kitchen, more time socializing.

I love to serve them with a simple side salad and all the fresh fixings. Load them up and enjoy with sliced jalapeños, chopped cilantro, sliced avocado, chopped red onions...etc. It’s a recipe the whole family will love and one you will be making over and over just like us. Enjoy!

### Recipe
Makes 6-8 Enchiladas
</br>
</br>

### Ingredients

* <span itemprop="ingredients">¾-1 lb of chicken thighs or breast cut up into small cubes (can also used minced turkey,chicken, beef or even shredded </span>rotisserie chicken*)
* <span itemprop="ingredients">2 tbsp olive oil</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">1 packet of taco seasoning (approx 28 grams/0.1 oz) or I always use the pioneer woman’s DYI taco seasoning -recipe below</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">¼ cup water</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">10-ounce package of frozen spinach, thawed and squeezed dry and chopped coarsely if needed </span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">1 cup frozen corn thawed</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">1½ cups grated white cheddar cheese (or texmex mix) </span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">1 cup heavy cream</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">2 4.5oz small cans of chopped green chillies</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">Salt and pepper to taste</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">8 corn tortillas (softened in the oven for a few minutes before assembling if needed- to make rolling easier)</span>

### Directions
1. Preheat oven to 400°F
2. In a medium sized skillet heat up oil on medium heat and cook chicken for 5-10 minutes until lightly brown and fully cooked
3. Add the taco seasoning and water and continue to sauté chicken for another few minutes until the water has completely reduced and then take off the heat and set aside
4. In a medium size bowl mix together the spinach, corn, 1 can of chillies, and 1 cup of cheese
5. In a separate bowl whisk together the heavy cream, the second can of chillies and salt and pepper to taste (I usually do approx ½ tsp of each)
6. Now it’s time to assemble the enchiladas. Get your shallow baking dish ready (I usually use and 8x10) and start assembling.
7. Lay out your corn tortilla on a plate and fill along the centre of the tortilla with approx 1⁄4 cup of ingredients half being the chicken and the other half the corn and spinach mixture. Roll the tortilla and place seam facing down into the baking dish
8. Do the same with the rest of the tortillas trying to divide the filling evenly. 
9. Pour over the heavy cream mixture evenly over the enchiladas, sprinkle the rest of the cheese over them too and cover dish with foil (spray foil with baking spray to prevent cheese from sticking to it) and bake for 20 minutes until bubbling
10. Remove foil and bake uncovered for another 10-15 minutes or until golden brown

### Homemade Taco Seasoning by the Pioneer Woman

### Ingredients
* 2 teaspoons Chilli Powder
* 1½ teaspoon Ground Cumin
* ½ teaspoon Paprika
* ½ teaspoon Crushed Red Pepper
* ½ teaspoon Salt
* ¼ teaspoon Garlic Powder
* ¼ teaspoon Onion Powder
* ¼ teaspoon Dried Oregano
* ¼ teaspoon Black Pepper

### Directions
Mix all spices together and that’s basically equivalent to a store-bought taco seasoning packet
</br>
</br>

### Recipe Notes
* If using leftover shredded rotisserie chicken there is no need to sauté it as long as raw Chicken. Just pan fry it with the taco seasoning until liquid has reduced. 

* To Make ahead just put everything together and cover tightly with foil and store in the fridge overnight and up to 12 hours. Bake the same way but increase covered bake time by a few minutes

* To Freeze, prep the enchiladas the exact same way only do not sprinkle with the last half cup of cheese. Wrap the dish tightly to seal it off and freeze for up to 3 months. When ready to bake sprinkle half cup of cheese over them and you may have to double the cooking time.

* For Vegetarian option omit the chicken altogether and enjoy as is or sub the chicken for sautéed or roasted veggies and black beans that you can sauté with the taco mix
