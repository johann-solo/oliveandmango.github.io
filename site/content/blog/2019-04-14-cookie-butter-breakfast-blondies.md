These blondies are made of oat flour, maple syrup and eggs - so they are practically breakfast I think, thus the name. In all seriousness these are so good and I couldn’t wait to share these with you. I got the inspiration to make these from Bon Appétit. Their version used a nut butter and flax seed meal and a few other minor changes.

Why did I make these with cookie butter? Good question. I have been dying to use my cookie butter in something baked. You see I’m a bit behind on the whole cookie butter trend as I have been living under a rock it seems for the last several years. Maybe It’s because I didn’t have it available in Trinidad but whatever the reason I’m so glad it’s entered into my life and so is my family. Cookie butter is a spread made from ground-up spice cookies called speculoos created in Europe. The paste created from these aromatic cookies is rich and indulgent with a wonderfully creamy consistency. It’s also super addictive.

It’s used in many baked goods and can be substituted for peanut butter or other nut butters and spreads. When I saw Bon Appétit’s recipe I had to experiment with it. I think flax seed meal/flax meal is great and all but I have used it in baked goods and I just don’t love the texture of it in them, so I thought about what else I could use that was healthy and breakfast - like instead of regular flour and something a bit more substantial than almond flour.

The answer was oat flour. I love using and making oat flour myself and when you have the best oats on hand, all you need is a high speed blender or food processor and you can have oat flour in no time. It’s simple to make and can be used in porridge for an extra creamy consistency, pancakes, oat bars, you name it. I love it in these blondies - the texture stays moist and not overly dense. <span class="highlight"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.bobsredmill.com/organic-regular-rolled-oats.html">Bob’s Red Mill Organic Old Fashioned Whole Grain Rolled Oats</a></span> are a fantastic source of fibre. Bob’s Red Mill offers the largest lines of organic, whole grain foods in the country. All of their products are certified Kosher and made with ingredients grown from non-GMO seeds. They are the oats I love and use in everything. The simple recipe for making oat-flour with their oats is below. An alternative would be to use their Whole Grain Oat flour as well. Either or is perfect for this recipe.

Back to these bars. The combination of nuts, brown butter, maple syrup and the cookie butter give these blondies the most amazing caramel aroma and flavour. They bake up beautifully with a nice and chewy, moist texture and with some bits of crunch from the nuts and the chocolate chips. Cooking the nuts helps toasts them up a bit and get even more flavour out of them and the ones you top the blondies with before they go into the oven get nice and crispy and delicious. I have made these several times already and they are a hit with all. The glaze puts them over the top adding more maple flavour and a touch of cinnamon accentuating the spice from the cookie butter. They are just the best and I hope you try them.

* <span itemprop="ingredients">2 tsp. vanilla extract</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">1 tsp. salt</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">½ tsp. baking powder</span>

__For the maple cinnamon glaze__

* <span itemprop="ingredients">1 cup powdered sugar</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">½ teaspoon ground cinnamon</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">1 tablespoon pure maple syrup</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">1 tablespoon milked milk alternative</span>

### Directions

1. Preheat oven to 350°F and line an 8x8" baking dish with a parchment paper, leaving an overhang on the sides. Grease parchment with butter or cooking spray 
2. Cook nuts and 6 Tbsp. butter in a medium skillet over medium heat, swirling pan often, until butter foams, then browns, 5–6 minutes the strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a large bowl; set the nuts aside. 
3. To the large bowl with the hot butter add the cookie butter, maple syrup, oat flour, cinnamon, vanilla, salt, and baking powder and whisk until smooth. 
4. Add the eggs one at a time, whisking well to incorporate after each addition. And once they are incorporated vigorously whisk batter until glossy and smooth, for about 1 minute. 
5. Stir in all but about 3 Tbsp. reserved nuts along with the chocolate chips. 
6. Scrape batter into prepared pan and spread in an even layer. Top with remaining nuts and some extra chocolate chips if you like your bars chocolatey 
7. Bake until top is puffed and lightly browned and a tester inserted into the center comes out with a few moist crumbs, approx 20-22 minutes. Let cool.
8. Meanwhile, mix together the powdered sugar, cinnamon, maple syrup, and milk until well combined. If the glaze is a little too thick, add a splash of milk to thin it out.
9. Remove blondies from pan using parchment overhang and cut them 
10. Drizzle the glaze over bars and serve.
