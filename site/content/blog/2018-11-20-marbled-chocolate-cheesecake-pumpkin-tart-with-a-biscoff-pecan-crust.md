I will start by telling you that this tart is quite irresistible. Bite after bite you will keep going back for more. I am not a fan of a plain pumpkin pie at all. If it’s served to me I will eat it but I would never crave it or and never be caught eyeing someones slice across the table. I want to like it but I just don’t. Now a doctored up pumpkin pie or tart is a different story. I have had caramel pumpkin chess pie and a maple one and definitely a cheese cake one and those I love, but not the basic no frills one. Basically I need a little extra added to pumpkin pie for it to wow me. This marbled chocolate cheesecake tart and also the other [Deliciously Light And Airy Pumpkin Tart](https://www.oliveandmango.com/deliciously-light-and-airy-pumpkin-tart/) that I have on the blog are not lacking at all in the flavour department and that is why I love them.

There is a bit of a story behind this tart. I use to make a full on pumpkin cheesecake - chocolate marbled with a chocolate biscuit crust and toffee chip layer over the crust which would melt when baked. It was my husband’s favorite. I made it for him while we were dating and he has never forgotten it. It was a recipe I had printed or photocopied from somewhere and I even remember what the printed sheets of it looked like. They were very much dog eared and I think I even had a few chocolate finger prints on them. They vanished though, never to be found when I moved out of my old place into our new place after I got married. I looked and I looked and searched on line for this recipe not remembering who or where I got it from. My husband was super disappointed and so this is why I made this tart. He was quite happy with this one too but I don’t think any one can quite measure up to the lost one, but this will have to do until the other one surfaces some way somehow.

One thing that this tart has going for it in comparison to a regular cheesecake is that it’s not as thick and dense and so it bakes much much faster. The faster it bakes the faster it can hit your lips so that is a win for me. It’s also super simple to whip up being that the crust is a cookie one requiring very little effort to make. Speaking of the crust, I choose a biscoff biscuit one for two reasons, one - I haven’t had them in forever and two - they have a beautiful caramel flavour that I thought would be reminiscent of the toffee chips at the bottom of the cheesecake I mentioned above, plus I think that caramel and pumpkin are wonderful tasting together. If you don’t have any biscoff biscuits available where you live that is quite alright. I have made this same tart with graham cracker crumbs and with ginger snap crumbs as well so feel free to substitute to suit.

## Recipe
### Ingredients

__For the crust__

1. Add the melted butter and stir to combine and press the wet crumbs into the bottom and sides of a 9” tart pan with a removable bottom. 
2. Bake in the preheated oven for 6-8 minutes or until the edges are turning gold and the bottom is set. 
3. Allow to cool completely on a baking rack while you make the filling.

4. In large bowl, beat cream cheese filling ingredients with electric mixer on medium speed until smooth and creamy. 
5. Reserve &frac23; cup cream cheese filling and transfer it to a small bowl, along with the melted chocolate. 
6. Mix until smooth and set aside

7. In small bowl, mix pumpkin filling ingredients. Add to remaining cream cheese filling; mix well and spoon into crust.

8. Spoon dollops of reserved chocolate cream cheese filling randomly over pumpkin filling. 
9. Swirl with knife to marble mixtures.

10. Bake 25 to 30 minutes or until set. Cool 10 minutes. Remove side of pan. Serve warm, or cool 1 hour and refrigerate until serving time.

11. Tart filling loosely based on a _Betty Crocker_ one
