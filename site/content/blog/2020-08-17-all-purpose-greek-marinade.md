This versatile Greek marinade or dressing is  so easy to whip up a batch of and so versatile. And you can keep it on hand for those busy weeknights when you need something quick!

With only a few simple ingredients it packs the chicken (or whatever you add it to) full of flavor and helps to tenderize the meat. I call it an all purpose Greek Marinade, because you can use it on just about anything.  I use it on chicken, pork and vegetables but it is amazing on steaks and lamb too and I know some of you love it as a salad dressing. It only takes a few minutes of marinating if you are using it with veggies and it’s also great to dress them with after they are grilled. When I use it as a meat marinade I allow the meat to hang out in it for 30 minutes before cooking it I’m rushing or overnight if I’m organized and have prepped in advance. You can use it for souvlaki- style cubed meat or for full pieces of meat.

I love how customizable it is.  If you like it more tangy you can up the lemon juice and red wine vinegar. If you like it more herby you can add more oregano or thyme. Same goes for how much garlic you want to add to it too. It’s made with basic pantry ingredients and elevates the flavour of anything that comes in contact with it. A good marinade goes a long way in making your meat tender and delicious and I think you will love this Greekstyle one!
