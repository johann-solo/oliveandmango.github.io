These scones are tender, buttery, and packed with juicy blackberries from our thriving blackberry bush in the back yard. The end of the summer always is fruitful in my parents garden and backyard. Their little blackberry bush has totally taken over that side of the garden this year and I have to say I’m loving it. This year the garden has been better than last. We were able to plant much more and have really been enjoying all it’s bounty.

Everything this year came in a bit later for us as spring was sort of delayed. I was wondering if our tomatoes would ever turn red from green and our blackberries purple from reddish pink.  The last week has seen those changes many times over as our blackberry bush has doubled in size this year and our tomato plants have been heavy with green tomatoes. Every time I go and check (daily) there is always something to pick from either.

One of my favorite things to make with fresh and delicious berries (after I have had my fill of them fresh that is) is make scones. They are fairly simple and straightforward to make  whether you are making them with or without a food processor. I have included directions for both methods below in case you don’t have a food processor.

I love blueberries and blackberries with lavender - they suit each other so well and I had to make a glaze with that heavenly aroma. Feel free to leave out the lavender (and skip the step of steeping the milk with lavender) if you just want some unadulterated blackberry scones. I loved them with or without and feel free to substitute any berry you would like if you don’t have blackberries. If you are using frozen berries make sure to keep them frozen. Do not thaw them and dust them lightly in a bit of flour before tossing them into the dough. These scones are loaded with blackberries - just the way I love my berry scones. Not overly sweet and so simple to make. I really hope you give them a try!

* <span itemprop="ingredients"> 2 tablespoons raw sugar, for sprinkling (optional) </span>

### Directions

1. Preheat oven to 400°F and line a large baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside.

1. Pulse the dry ingredients (flour, salt, baking powder, baking soda, sugar and the lime zest) a few time in a food processor and then pulse the stick of butter that has been sliced into the flour Approx 18-20 times until coarse crumble forms. (alternatively whisk those ingredients in a large bowl to combine. Add the cut cold butter and then work them into the mixture (using your fingers, two forks, or a pastry cutter) until lit resembles a coarse meal. 

1. In a small bowl, whisk together the egg and milk. Pour mixture into the dry ingredients and pulse a few times until dough forms - being careful to not over work - or pour into bowl with dry ingredients and use the fork to stir everything together until just moistened.

1. If using food processor empty the loose dough out onto a lightly floured work surface, add the blackberries to the dough and gently fold them into the dough. Once they are pretty evenly distributed, shape the dough into an 8-inch circle. (If making dough by hand add blackberries and gently stir into dough. Don’t worry if some of the berries break up a bit) 
2. Shape the dough into an 8-inch circle and then cut the dough into 8 wedges and carefully transfer to the prepared baking sheet.

3. Freeze until firm, approx 20 minutes.

4. Meanwhile preheat oven to 400°F.

5. Brush scones with buttermilk and sprinkle with raw sugar. Bake until golden brown, 20–25 minutes. Once done allow scones to cool on the baking sheet while you make the glaze.

__For the glaze__

1. Place the milk and butter in a small saucepan and set over medium heat. Cook until the milk is just steaming, but not boiling. Remove from the heat and stir in the lavender. Cover and steep 5 minutes. 
2. Strain the milk through a fine mesh sieve and discard the lavender. Stir in the the powdered sugar, adding milk as needed to thin the glaze.
3. Drizzle the glaze over each scone and garnish with lavender. (The lavender glaze is optional - you can just make the glaze without steeping the milk, omit the lavender and just whisk together the rest of the ingredients along with a &frac12; tsp of lemon zest if you want a lemony note in the glaze)
