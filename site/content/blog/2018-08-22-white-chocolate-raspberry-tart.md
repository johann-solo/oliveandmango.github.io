White chocolate and raspberries go together in the dessert world like chocolate and hazelnut. They are the perfect match. The white chocolate is rich and sweet and creamy and the raspberries have a very shy kind of sweetness overpowered by their more pronounced tartness. They cut through the richness of the white chocolate and wake up your taste buds with fruitiness. The base of both the vegan and non vegan tarts is wonderful. Buttery tasting and the perfect sweet, crispy, crumbly crust for these decadent tarts.

Why the vegan option? Two reasons really. A lot of you guys ask me for vegan options and I love to experiment with certain recipes that I think I can convert. It’s like a little challenge and sometimes I like a good challenge. Secondly my mother in law is vegan, and although I have yet to share anything vegan that I have made with her - when I’m making something vegan I always ask myself If my mother in law would like it and eat it. So there, now you know.

It would really be hard to choose which one I prefer best. They both have unique and delicious things about them. My mother and father (both not vegan) both preferred the vegan one as they found the non vegan was a little rich for them. They loved it but found the vegan one a little lighter. If you twisted my arm and made me choose I would say the non vegan one because I love how the white chocolate ganache gets a little oozey when it comes to room temperature. I loved the vegan one too because it has a lighter filling and I love the very subtle hint of coconut oil from the crust and the cocoa butter is just divine. Let’s put it this way - I could have a full slice of the vegan one easily but only half of the non vegan as it’s also too rich and decadent for me. My brother and husband on the other hand could eat two of those non vegan ones and still have a hankering for more. They definitely love their rich, decadent and sweet things.

Both are perfect for making ahead and would be great for a dinner party! The non vegan one has a wonderful crust but requires that the crust be rolled out for each individual tart. The vegan one just needs to be mixed and the pressed into the mold which makes it slightly easier and quicker to make. Both are delightful and both can be made with any berry as a substitute for raspberries if you would prefer something different or you just don’t have them available. We all truly loved them both and I think it’s great to always have a vegan tart up your sleeve for those occasions where you might be entertained by or entertaining someone who is vegan.

## Recipe

## White Chocolate Ganache Raspberry Tart (vegan)
Makes one 9 inch tart or pie
</br>
</br>

### Ingredients

__For the vegan pâté sucrée tart__

* &frac14; cup ground hazelnuts or almonds
* 1&frac14; cups flour plus more if needed and for dusting
* &frac12; cup coconut oil
* &frac12; cup sugar
* &frac12; tsp salt
* 1 tsp vanilla extract
* 2-3 tbsp of almond milk or coconut milk as needed to moisten the dough if needed

__For raspberry coulis__

* 2 cups fresh or frozen raspberries
* &frac13; cup of sugar (just enough to add a slight bit of sweetness to the raspberries)

__For vegan white chocolate ganache filling__

* 200 grams of cocoa butter/ non dairy unsweetened white chocolate
* 2OO ml of coconut cream / milk
* &frac12; cup of confectioners sugar
* 8 grams package of vanilla powder or 1 tsp vanilla extract

### Directions

1. In a large bowl, beat together sugar, salt, and oil until smooth and combined.

2. Beat in the flour until the dough forms crumbs. When the dough forms slightly coarser crumbs, then it’s good. Feel free to add non dairy milk to help you achieve the texture you need 1 tbsp at a time. The mixture should be able to clump easily when pressed together. You don’t need to beat the dough too much, as it’s easier to work into the tart shell in crumbs than in clumps.
3. Transfer to tart pan and then press it into the tart pan with your fingers making sure it’s tightly pressed into the bottom edges of pan. prick the dough all over with a fork and let it rest in the fridge for 30 minutes.
4. Preheat oven to 350 &deg; F and bake for 15 minutes to Blind Bake then you can then fill the tart shell and bake the tart again for another 20 to 40 minutes, depending on the filling.
5. In this case I didn’t blind bake but baked it right through for approx 35 minutes until edges were fully baked and golden as I was filling tart with a no bake filling. Allow the tart to cool on a rack completely before filling.
6. In the meantime make the raspberry coulis, bring the raspberries and sugar to the boil in a small heavy-based saucepan over high heat, stirring until the sugar dissolves. Using a blender or immersion blender to blend until a puree forms, then transfer to a bowl, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until needed
7. Next make the white chocolate ganache. In a medium sauce pan on medium heat melt cocoa butter or unsweetened vegan white chocolate with coconut cream, along with the vanilla powder, stir until smooth and remove from heat
8. To assemble the tarts, spoon in enough raspberry coulis to coat the base of the tart shell well.
9. Pour white chocolate filling into crust over the raspberry coulis and refrigerate for 2 hrs before serving.
10. Garnish with fresh berries or fruits, slice and enjoy!

## White Chocolate Ganache Raspberry Tart (non-vegan)
</br>

### Ingredients

__For the tart shells__ (Makes 10 small tartlets)

* 2&frac14; cups All purpose flour
* &frac14; Cup hazelnut flour or ground hazelnut or almond flour or ground almonds 
* &frac14; Cup Sugar
* 8 ounces or 2 sticks  Unsalted cold butter cut into pieces 
* &frac14; teaspoon Salt
* 3 Egg Yolks
* 2-3 tablespoons Heavy cream

__For the raspberry coulis__

* 2 cups fresh or frozen raspberries plus extra fresh berries or other fruit to top tart with
* &frac13; cup of sugar (just enough to add a slight bit of sweetness to the raspberries)

__For the white chocolate ganache__

* 350 g or approx 2 cups of white chocolate chips or roughly chopped
* 350 ml of heavy cream

### Directions

1. Put flour, Hazel nut flour, sugar and salt in the food processor and pulse just to combine. 
2. Add your butter and pulse until it resembles crumbs. 
3. Add the egg yolks and 2 TBS cream pulse until the dough comes together. If too dry add the other TBS of cream if you find it still has not come together add more cream a TSP at a time, and be careful not to over process.
4. Remove dough from processor and form into a large log wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least an hour
5. Unwrap the pastry and cut off 10 even slices from each log, then roll each slice until approx 3 mm thick. Carefully transfer and line individual tart tins with a piece of dough, making sure to push the pastry into the corners of each tin to prevent shrinkage. 
6. Pinch off any excess pastry, then press the dough with a fork a few times to prevent it rising during baking. Place on a baking tray and refrigerate for 10 minutes.
7. Preheat oven to 375 &deg; F
8. Place the tray with the lined tart shells in the preheated oven and bake for 12–15 minutes or until golden brown. Leave the shells to cool in the tins completely, then remove from the tins.
9. To make the raspberry coulis, bring the raspberries and sugar to the boil in a small heavy-based saucepan over high heat, stirring until the sugar dissolves. Using a blender or immersion blender to blend until a puree forms, then transfer to a bowl, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until needed
10. To make the ganache, heat the cream in a small heavy-based saucepan over medium high heat until hot but not boiling. Remove from the heat, add the white chocolate and whisk until combined and smooth. 
11. Set aside to cool completely, then transfer to a piping bag or a measuring cup with a pourable lip.
12. To assemble the tarts, spoon in enough raspberry coulis to coat the base of each tart shell well. 
13. Fill each shell with ganache and refrigerate for at least 1-2 hours then serve with some more raspberries other fruit or berry you would like
