This thick and rich chocolate sauce is perfect over ice cream. It’s so easy to make and stores very well in the fridge. Just reheat as needed and enjoy!

Other than eating it by the spoonful and poured over ice cream and banana splits -  you can also enjoy it drizzled over brownies or soufflés, for dipping or drizzling over fruit, drizzling over hot or cold cocoa beverages and also great in ice cream cakes or over them like in my [Hula pie recipe](https://www.oliveandmango.com/hula-pie-ice-cream-pie/). It’s made with simple pantry ingredients with no additives like the store bought stuff. It’s irresistible and you won’t regret making a batch!
