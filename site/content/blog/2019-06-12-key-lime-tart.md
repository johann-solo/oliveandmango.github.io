A silky smooth filling that is so simple to make and only 4 ingredients. The ginger snap base adds a delicious flavour with lime and a crispy base. When you are craving a citrus pie but don’t want to fuss with pastry cream or a pastry crust this is the best choice. It also bakes up - crust and filling-  in under 30 minutes. A quick and easy dessert like this is perfect for the Summer when you don’t feel like making anything that requires too much oven time and is delicious served cold. I saved this recipe not too long ago from _NYT Cooking_ and I finally got a chance to make it. I saw that limes were on sale and thought of this pie. I bought a huge bagful because you really can never have enough limes and lemons and couldn’t wait to try it.

## A lime tart with a ginger snap cookie base
I decided to use ginger snap cookies for the base because I love ginger and lime together but a graham cracker base would be great as well, maybe with a bit of dried coconut in the mix for a bit of a tropical twist. Just swap out the ginger snaps for graham crackers if you prefer a more traditional crust. When it comes to the filling I stuck to what the recipe called for. Although I’m pretty sure this tart would be great with any citrus you use. I can't wait to try it with lemons or blood oranges the next time they are plentiful.

## How to make the perfect lime tart
This pie could not be easier and I can’t wait for you guys to try it! You will love it! Perfect sweetness to tart ratio and is also the perfect canvas to have some fun with when it comes to topping it. I used lime slices and edible spring pansies. But this tart is also so delicious topped with a few dollops or swirls of whip cream. It’s the perfect way to satisfy your citrus pie craving with little effort and time, a total win for me!
