This is my go to, no-fail recipe for easy roasted potatoes that are roasted to perfection. Any leftovers, and there are rarely any leftovers, are perfect for breakfast the next day. I love to heat them up in the same pan that I’m frying my egg in and tada you have a fantastic breakfast - with buttery hash included. They serve as a perfect side to any meal and are truly beloved. I blame those perfectly crisp edges and their buttery flavour for that. Totally irresistible!

I love making them in my cast iron skillet because they roast evenly in it and develop those crispy edges on the top and bottom of them. They require a little concentrated effort to slice, but once you have a good knife in tow that can be done in a jiffy. When [Zwilling](https://www.zwilling.ca) sent me their [ZWILLING NOW 6 PIECE KNIFE BLOCK SET](https://www.zwilling.ca/category/kitchen/kitchen-knives/shop-knives-by-series/shop-knife-series-zwilling-now/) I knew this is the recipe I would make to test out these brand new knives and they did not disappoint. The set comes with a Chinese chef knife, a chopper, a vegetable knife, a petty and a santoku. I can already tell I will be using the santoku as my go to for a lot of my food prep along with the chopper.

[Zwilling](https://www.zwilling.ca) has long been a trusted and quality brand in general but also in my home. I have always had, owned and used my trusty [Zwilling](https://www.zwilling.ca) block sets and so has my mom. I was sad to have to give away my last set when I left Trinidad, but it’s in good hands and will be well used. I was so happy to receive this set with a sleek new look and colour of the block and knife handles and even more thrilled when [Zwilling](https://www.zwilling.ca) wanted to partner up for a recipe and a giveaway of their [NOW set](https://www.zwilling.ca/category/kitchen/kitchen-knives/shop-knives-by-series/shop-knife-series-zwilling-now/) in Granada (the name of the color of the knife set not the island by the way). Make sure and check out my Instagram post to enter or feel free to leave a comment below and I will add you to the list of qualifiers. **This is a giveaway for Canadian residents only**. I’m so happy with the set and I’m absolutely certain that you will be too.

Their blades are made of stainless special formula steel, and made for the best combination of flexibility, durable sharpness and anti-corrosion. The handles are well shaped, allowing for practical and safe operation and I love the colours of their [NOW collection](https://www.zwilling.ca/category/kitchen/kitchen-knives/shop-knives-by-series/shop-knife-series-zwilling-now/). Very unique and trendy, just to name a few of the features of the knives in this giveaway.

Let’s talk a little more about these potatoes. They are actually quite versatile. As long as your butter, salt and potato ratios stay the same, you can use any herb or added spice to change these up a bit to suit your taste or whatever you are serving these up with. Who would have thought so few ingredient could make something so fabulous - I did because it’s potatoes and butter after all. If it works for mashed potatoes it definitely works with roasted. It’s the easiest side you will ever whip up with the biggest return not in leftovers but of love for these potatoes by all those you serve them too. Make sure you add them to your list of sides for entertaining or to enjoy in the midweek.

### Directions

1. Preheat an oven to 375°F

3. Brush the bottom of a large fry pan or skillet with 2 tbsp. of the melted butter. 
4. Arrange the potato slices vertically but at a slight angle in a circular pattern in the dish, filling it completely. 
5. Pour the remaining 6 tbsp. melted butter over the potatoes and sprinkle with the thyme, salt and chopped garlic.
6. Roast until the top edges of the potatoes are crispy, about 50-60 minutes, sprinkle with Parmesan cheese and bake for another 10 minutes or until cheese is melted and golden.
7. Let stand for 10 minutes before serving then dig in!
