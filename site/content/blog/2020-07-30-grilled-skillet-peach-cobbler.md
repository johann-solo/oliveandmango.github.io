Make an incredibly delicious peach cobbler grill style, by cooking this dessert, peaches and all on the BBQ (or in oven)! This skillet peach cobbler is the perfect ending to your BBQ. Packed full of juicy peaches and topped with almond flour biscuits with cinnamon sugar.

If you really want to make the best Grilled Skillet Peach Cobbler ever you need to make sure your peaches are sweet and your grill is hot. Serve it right off the grill - warm, with a big old scoop of ice cream on top. A cast iron skillet is the perfect pan for this delicious cobbler. I think it gives it more flavor and it’s so easy to use on the grill or to bake with, but if you don’t have one any oven/grill safe pan will work. Just be careful putting it on and taking it off the grill or in and out the oven.

## How to make a Skillet Peach Cobbler
First heat up your grill one side only to control amount of heat. Toss your peaches (peeled or unpeeled, your choice) with some sugar and spice and then toss them and their juices into your buttered skillet. Grill them covered for 10-12 minutes. Next you will mix up the ingredients for the almond flour biscuits and the cinnamon sugar in a mixing bowl. And you can scoop them carefully right on to the peaches when ready. Brush them with egg wash and sprinkle on the cinnamon sugar and then grill for another 10-15 minutes until they are golden and the peaches are bubbling. Then pull it off the grill carefully, allow to cool for a few minutes then dig in!!

## How can I make this recipe fully paleo? 
This recipe is easily adapted to be 100 percent paleo. All you have to do is replace the sugar in the recipe with paleo friendly sweeteners. My favourite natural sweeteners are maple syrup, and raw honey. If I want a dry alternative for baking or for the cinnamon sugar topping on these paleo biscuits I use coconut sugar or maple sugar. You can use a non dairy milk for the egg wash or leave it out if you are on a dairy free paleo diet. I would recommend using arrowroot flour or tapioca flour instead of all purpose flour to keep this paleo. I always use Bob’s Red Mill Tapioca starch in the filling and the biscuits are made with Bob’s Red Mill Almond flour. Bob’s Red Mill has all the products you need for all your baking needs while catering to those in your family who have specific food allergies with organic, gluten free, paleo, and vegan options - perfect for any summer recipe. The biscuits grill up beautifully on the cobbler but you can also bake them up separately if you wanted to make plain biscuits to enjoy with bacon and eggs or even if you wanted to make them with some fruit in them. More on that below under recipe notes.

## Can I add another fruit?
Yes! I recommend using fruits that are soft and don’t require a ton of cooking time like berries and other stone fruit would be great. If you use apples or pears I would make sure to slice them very thinly so they cook faster. You can even combine fruits. I love peaches with blackberries so that would be a great combo for this cobbler.

This is a great cobbler recipe that is so easy to whip up. It’s quite impressive to pull out a dessert from the grill that’s bubbling and delicious. It’s one that is easy to take to a bbq and ask your host for some grill time after the steaks and chicken have had there time on the grill. I usually have my dough premade in a bowl in a cooler with my scoop ready or I have them pre-scooped out in a tupperware or something like that already brushed with egg wash and sprinkled with cinnamon sugar ready to slide on. I bring my skillet already buttered and with my fruit in it covered in foil so it’s ready to go on the grill just like that. Bring the cobbler and get the host to provide the icecream and you’re set. If you dont have a grill or just not into grilling this recipe can easily be made in the oven too. Full details about that below. You will love how simple this peach cobbler is to make and how great it bakes up or grills up every time! Enjoy!

### Directions

1. Heat ONE side of grill to medium-high (350°F to 400°F). 

1. Place peaches in a large bowl. Whisk together sugar, flour with the salt and spices in a small bowl. Sprinkle mixture over peaches, then drizzle in the lemon juice and vanilla and stir gently to combine. 

1. Spoon peach mixture into a buttered 9-10-inch cast-iron skillet (the peaches will cook down so don’t worry if you over fill a bit) Cut 2 tablespoons butter into small pieces over peaches if using and then cover skillet tightly with aluminum foil. Place skillet over lit side of grill, and grill, covered, until bubbling and hot, about 10-12 minutes.

1. While the peaches are grilling make your biscuits:
Whisk almond flour, baking soda, cinnamon, sugar and salt together in a bowl; stir in coconut oil first, then the egg and vanilla until fully incorporated and dough ball forms. 

1. Remove foil form pan carefully and scoop dough using an ice cream scoop and dollop it  straight on to the peaches when ready. (Alternative method in recipe notes) Brush with egg wash and sprinkle with cinnamon sugar and continue grilling foil off and with lid shut 10-12 minutes more until they are cooked through, golden and filling is bubbling. Remove skillet from grill carefully, and let stand 10 minutes before serving.

### Recipe Notes  

## Can I make the biscuits ahead of time? 
• You can form the dough and scoop it onto a lined dish. Brush them with egg wash and sprinkle them with the cinnamon sugar off the grill and then when ready you can use a spatula to slide them onto the bubbling fruit to save you doing all of that over the hot grill. Either way is fine though. When I make them ahead I place plastic wrap over them and keep them chilled until I have to put them on the cobbler. 
</br>
</br>

## Can I make my cobbler with more biscuits on it? 
• You can also double the dough recipe to have a more covered up sort of cobbler. 
</br>
</br>

## Can I make this cobbler in the oven?
• You can make the whole cobbler in the oven at 350°F and with the same method. The baking time may vary slightly. Add an extra 5-10 minutes to the initial baking time with the foil on top to ensure peaches are cooked through enough 
</br>
</br>

## Can I bake these biscuits separately? 
• These almond flour biscuits are great on their own as well. If you wanted to bake up a batch of them without the cobbler just scoop them out onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and bake at 350°F for 12-15 minutes. You can also add up to &frac14; cup of fruit or even cheese or precooked bacon pieces into the batter to switch them up.
