I totally love sharing super simple recipes like this! This soup has a regular weekly feature in our home.  I do many variations of it. If I can’t get my hands on butternut squash I sub in pumpkin or sweet potatoes.

It has a bright flavour, a wonderful sweetness from the squash and wonderful tones of warm spice from the curry paste.  The coconut milk makes it wonderfully creamy and rich.  The lime and cilantro brighten and heighten the flavours and the spiced nuts give it crunch. Totally balanced and totally delicious.

I usually roast my veggies when I’m making a creamy soup like this. It does make a difference and elevates and intensifies the flavours of it.  It adds a wonderful deeper sweetness to whatever you are roasting and also adds a nice nuttiness. If you don’t want to bother with the roasting that is ok too.  You can cut up the butternut squash just the same and chop your garlic and just add into the pot after sautéing the onions and allow the squash to simmer for 20 minutes along with the other ingredients in the broth until very soft and tender. You may need to add a little more broth because some will evaporate during the cooking/simmering process so just keep that in mind.  You can adjust that as needed.

The roasted spiced nuts are a great addition – they are the perfect accompaniment to Thai flavours. They are also completely optional to make and include. They can either be roasted as directed below or you can pan roast them on the stove top according to whatever is easier for you.  They add the perfect crunch with a subtle bit of heat and warm spice.  And if you have any extra they are great to snack on!

* 1 large onion, peeled and chopped
* 4 large garlic cloves, peeled and chopped

<br>
<br>

### Directions

1. Preheat oven to 400°F
1. Toss the squash and garlic in a large baking sheet with 2 tbsp of olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste.
1. Roast for approx 15-20 minutes or until tender and starting to get golden on the edges, tossing once half way through. Remove when done and set aside. (Check post above for making it the non-roasted version)
1. In a large heavy bottom pot heat oil over medium heat and add the onions and sauté until soft and translucent.
1. Add the Thai curry paste and extra ground spices if using and sauté for another minute and then add the roasted squash and garlic, ginger.  
1. Stir well to combine and then add the broth and bring to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer for 10-15 minutes for all the flavours to combine.  
1. Remove the pot from heat and blend soup carefully in batches in a blender or use an immersion blender to blend  it until smooth and creamy.
1. Put the pot back on the burner and stir in the coconut milk and heat though.  Thin the soup out by adding a little extra broth or water if needed. Season well with salt and pepper as needed.
1. Serve with a squeeze of lime and with some crunchy spiced peanuts and chopped cilantro or chadon beni  


## Spicy roasted peanuts

### Ingredients

1. 1 cup raw shelled peanuts (if you use dry roasted then reduce roasting time)
1. 1 tsp coconut oil
1. 1 dry kefir lime leaf crumbled or ground (optional)
1. 1 tsp of Chile powder
1. &frac14; tsp salt
1. 1 tsp fresh lime juice
1. 1 tsp of chopped cilantro or chadon Beni
<br>

### Directions

1. Heat the oven to 350°F.  
1. Combine nuts, oil, ground kefir lime leaf, chili powder and salt in a large bowl and mix until well coated.
1. Transfer to baking sheet and roast until the peanuts are golden brown and everything is fragrant, about 20 to 30 minutes.  If using already roasted peanuts just roast for 7-10 minutes to get them nice and golden and crunchy.  
1. Remove from the oven and toss them with the lime and cilantro and set aside to cool and then serve.
