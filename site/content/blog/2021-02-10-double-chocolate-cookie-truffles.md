These double chocolate cookie truffles are super chocolatey, slightly tangy from the cream cheese in them with a smooth exterior and a thick, rich, slightly chewy filling. They are seriously the best little treat. It’s almost impossible to not pop one of these babies into your mouth. This is a sweet and indulgent no-bake 3 ingredient recipe that's ready in under 45 minutes! SO EASY to whip up for a party or get together or to share with friends or workmates. Anyone can make these and they are an all-time family favorite!

These truffles are most commonly made with Oreo cookies which I love very much but both me and my hubby are very much team Fudgee o’s. Can’t beat that rich fudge center. That is why I decided to make these using chocolate fudge filled sandwich cookies. You can use any filled cookie you like. I have seen lots of these made with all the various filled Oreo cookies and they work marvelously. The only thing I would recommend is to use the original ones not the double stuffed ones as this would throw off the texture of these. While I typically prefer treats that are more homemade, sandwich filled cookie are a bit of my weakness!! These are too good not to make and share.

I made these and shared them with some friends as a gift and sweet treat and they were a nice way to share a little love. I actually recommend doing the same thing - these are a treat that is definitely made to be shared otherwise there will be trouble. This batch usually makes about 36 truffles - so you will have all 36 of these guys calling your name. Once you try one you will understand why - they are just so good!

Not only are they easy to make but they are also made with a few ingredients and come together so fast. You do need to have a little patience while they chill but you can make and enjoy these within about 1 hour. It’s definitely a treat I make a lot to share and will continue to make again and again. Hope you enjoy them!

</form></div>

<div>Servings: <span itemprop="recipeYield">36 truffles</div>
<div>Prep Time: <meta itemprop="prepTime" content="PT25M">25 mins</div>
<div>Cook Time: <meta itemprop="cookTime" content="PT5M">5 mins</div>
</br>

### Ingredients
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">36 Fudgeeo cookies (or any fudge sandwich cookies - original not double stuffed) plus 2-3 extra crushed for topping which is optional </span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 (8 oz) pkg. cream cheese, cubed and softened </span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">16 oz each of white chocolate and milk chocolate or dark chocolate, melted (plus more if needed) </span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1-2 drops of natural red food colouring if you wanted to tint the white chocolate pink (optional) </span>
</br>
</br>

### Directions
1. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside 
2. Place 36 Fudgeeos in a food processor (filling included) and process until they are fine crumbs (if you don’t have processor you can also crush them in a large resealable bag with a rolling pin over them) 
3. Add cream cheese and pulse until well combined and mixture can be pressed or shaped (if you don’t have a processor just empty crumbs into bowl and stir in the cream cheese until combined) 
4. Scoop mixture out by approx 1 Tbsp at a time and roll into 1 inch balls then place on prepared baking sheet 
5. Place truffles in freezer for at least 15 min (these can be made ahead and kept frozen or in the fridge covered in plastic wrap for 1-2 days)
6. Meanwhile crush remaining 3 cookies if you wanted to use the crumbs as a topping - (optional) 
7. Remove truffles from freezer and dip in melted chocolate (I use a fork to hold them on and use a spoon to pour some chocolate over the top then lift and allow excess chocolate to run off and use a butter knife to slide them off fork and onto baking sheet (see video for the how to)
8. Return to baking sheet, immediately sprinkle tops with crushed cookie crumbs if desired, then allow chocolate to set. The chocolate sets in minutes once they are dipped. Once it’s set you can drizzle on stripes of the opposite chocolate on each truffle if you like. 
9. Store in an airtight container in refrigerator.

### Recipe Notes
* These truffles use cream cheese, so they have to be refrigerated. First for food safety, but also because they soften as they sit out at room temperature, and won’t hold the truffle together well if it gets too warm. They can be left at room temperature for up to 2 hours. 
* How to store OREO Cookie Balls: Because of the cream cheese, store these in the refrigerator. Wrapped up, they should keep 3 to 4 weeks.
* Freezing Oreo truffles: hey freeze beautifully, making this recipe the best yet for making ahead of time in big batches. You can place the truffle cookies in an airtight container and freeze them for up to 4 months. Move them to the refrigerator for a few hours before you need them. They’ll thaw out and be ready to serve.
* Melting chocolate in the microwave: Place chopped chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl; microwave in 30-second intervals, stirring between each, until smooth and melted.
Melting chocolate on the stove: Place chocolate in the top of a double boiler or a heatproof bowl set over — but not in — a saucepan of simmering water; cook, stirring occasionally, until melted, 2 to 3 minutes.
* If your chocolate coating is too thick (if you’re using chocolate chips or chopped chunks of chocolate) you may want to thin out your chocolate with just a drop or two of coconut oil, it’ll make dipping much easier. It may start to thicken as it cools - feel free to reheat it again in between dunks if needed. 
* For a chocolate mint version: Mix 1&frac12; tsp of peppermint extract with the cream cheese first, then add it to the Oreo crumbs and continue as directed. Dip chocolates as you normally would and then immediately sprinkle tops with peppermint bits of crushed candy or chocolate
