### Recipe

Servings: <span itemprop="recipeYield">Serves 8-10   
</br>

### Ingredients

* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">12 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened</span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">&frac12; cup sugar</span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">&frac14; teaspoon almond extract</span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 &frac12; cups all-purpose flour</span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Pinch of salt</span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">&frac12; cup jam of your choice (I used my homemade tomato jam) </span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">&frac13; cup sliced almonds</span>
</br>

### Directions

1. Pre-heat oven to 350°F. 
1. Place the butter, and sugar in the bowl and using a mixer beat on medium speed until the mixture is very light and fluffy, about 3 to 5 minutes. Add the almond extract and beat until combined. 
1. In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour and salt. Add dry ingredients to the butter mixture and beat on low speed until dough is thoroughly combined. Scoop out &frac12; cup of the dough and set it on a small plate, place plate in the freezer allowing it to chill before crumbling. 
1. Press the rest of the dough into a 9 or 9 &frac12;-inch tart pan in an even layer coming up the edge a little. If the dough is too sticky, just chill it briefly.
1. Spread the jam in a thin, even layer over the surface of the dough.
1. Remove the reserved dough from the freezer and crumble it over the jam. Sprinkle the sliced almonds over top of the tart.
1. Bake for 40 to 50 minutes, or until the topping is golden brown. Remove from the oven and place on a rack to cool completely. 1. Remove from pan onto a plate or slice right out of the pan.

### How to store

* Tart can be stored covered in plastic wrap, at room temperature for up to 3-4 days. 

### How to make ahead

* You can make the tart ahead and freeze for up to 1 month. Once tart is made, wrap  it tightly twice in plastic wrap and freeze on a flat surface -- it may require a few extra minutes of baking time.
