excerpt: A serene retreat nestled in the warmth of Tobago
---

There are some beautiful hotels and resorts in Tobago and but there only few that are as peaceful and as memorable as Mt Irvine Bay Resort. It’s set on 154 acres of beautiful rolling greens, on an old sugar and coconut plantation overlooking the Caribbean Sea. It’s located away from the crowds but still accessible which makes it a place of serenity. A place where you can breathe easy, put your feet up and enjoy the Caribbean breeze whether you are dining alfresco, enjoying an afternoon swim, a stroll around the resort or enjoying it by the beach.

This iconic Tobago resort opened it’s doors in 1972 and is the largest privately owned resort on the island. It’s been a popular resort for travellers from all over the world and by local vacationers as well. It is located just 15 minutes from the airport and located just across the street from a pristine beach area. The resort began renovations in 2015 to upgrade and maintain the beautiful facilities for the comfort of it guests. The rooms are spacious and have everything you need for your comfort and convenience and are located within 18 beautiful acres of landscaped gardens.

The staff is helpful and friendly and goes the extra mile. We were warmly welcomed and our transition for the airport to the resort was seamless. We were greeted and served a welcoming cocktail and as soon as you step into that beautiful lobby you feel relaxed and welcome.

The pool area is pristine and also welcoming. There is a swim up bar if you want to enjoy a cocktail by the pool. The beach is a nice and short stroll away from the resort and the resort has changing facilities as well as dining facilities right on the beach. Chair and umbrellas are set up for guest and you can laze away all day with all the conveniences of the resort just a few steps away. You can also enjoy other beach activities and rent snorkelling and diving gear arranged by the resort and even excursions around the island.

The resort has one main eating area outside of the beach facility and also has room service available if you prefer to eat in your room overlooking the gardens or the sea. The restaurant is called the Sugar Mill appropriately as it sits under high ceilings and sweeping rafters that is so iconic to the resort. The buffet breakfast is quite delicious serving local foods and also a variety of baked goods and also some breakfast favourites including pancakes, bacon and custom made omelettes made to order. Their flying fish was one of my favourite things to eat for breakfast with their warm freshly baked coconut bake along with all the fresh local fruit.

We had a tremendous culinary experience thanks to the resort and management staff. We arrived and enjoyed a full dinner sampling some of the classics and favourites of the resorts newly revised menu. We were welcomed to dinner with a spritz which we happily sipped on as we enjoyed our appetiser which was a creamy buttery chicken liver pate infused with peppercorns and a well aged rum. I think that I could live off eating just that and bread.

That was followed by a bright chefs garden salad with a choice of creamy dressing or vinaigrette. Then we enjoyed succulent shrimp tempura in a luscious oyster ginger sauce served over herbed mashed eddoes (a root vegetable in the taro family).  We had those mashed herbed eddoes in another dish and I couldn’t get enough. They were fabulous and I wondered why I never thought to mash eddoes before. The tempura was served with green garlic bundles and orange glazed carrots which tasted like candy and were perfectly cooked.  Dessert came next and we were happy we had room for it. It was a fabulous chocolate brownie made from local Trinbagonian rich and delicious cocoa and it was served with locally made ice cream. A very sweet end to our first night at the resort.

The following day we enjoy another amazing culinary experience. We had the chef cook our lunch right in front of us. The lunch started with the resorts signature appetiser which they call Tobago ceviche which is the catch of the day marinated in lime juice and tossed with onion and peppers. It was delicious and I could have been content with eating a few servings of that ceviche alone. Then came the main attraction. We saw the chef in action preparing our catch of the day and our perfectly grilled chicken right before our eyes. Both were served with perfectly al dente fettuccine with an olio sauce made of olive oil, garlic, chili, Parmesan and fresh parsley. Then came the grand finale and something I thoroughly enjoyed - the sugar mill orange mousse. Total bliss, spoonful after spoonful.

Dinner was just as decadent and delicious starting with Trinidad crab back which is flaked crab meat sautéed with chives and onions and seafood crepes filed with shrimp, crab and fish drizzled with a creamy white wine sauce. This was followed by coconut creole catch of the day which was fried then sautéed in a lovely coconut curry sauce. We also were spoiled with the golden grove rack of lamb that was perfectly tender served with a rosemary sauce and cooked exactly as we ordered. It was served alongside buttered sweet potatoes and pan fried veggies. A perfectly balanced meal.  Next came dessert and I could not eat a whole dessert on my own after all that food so Johann and I shared and I regretted that decision after having a bite of it. It was a delicious pineapple ginger cheese cake - light and smooth and refreshing.

We enjoyed the breakfast buffet one last time before we left along with some lighter fair that was also wonderful on our last day there. The menu has something for everyone and at different price points. We enjoyed everything we ate thoroughly and cannot wait to visit again.

We spent the rest of the last day there relaxing by the pool, enjoyed a latte at the lovely hummingbird lounge adjacent to the bar and also got a little beach time in. We took some last snaps of the beautiful Caribbean sunset and then we were off.

The hotel organised transportation for us to the airport. They were punctual to pick us up and then we were back in Trinidad and reality, wondering when the next visit to the welcoming and serene Mt Irvine Bay resort will be. Hopefully soon!
