Who can resist a warm stack of pancakes drizzled with maple syrup? Definitely not my family. They can eat what seems like endless stacks of them. When I do make them I usually keep them warm in the oven but if I’m making them for the whole family or for a big brunch and need to make several batches, they don’t don’t hold up very well. By the time they hit the table they are all limp and lukewarm. I got a really good idea for solving that problem plus for making a fun looking breakfast for the whole family or if you are hosting brunch. It’s just the best. You still make the pancakes, but you don’t have to worry about keeping them warm. They all get stacked into a casserole dish drizzled with slightly sweetened milk and whisked eggs and loaded with fruits and then baked off into a baked French toast. The best part about it is that it can all be prepared the night before and then baked off in the morning right before you want to serve them. They come (all of them) out of the oven perfectly warm and ready to serve.

Another great thing about this baked pancake French toast is that it’s loaded with protein and it’s not just cause it’s got 6 eggs in it either, although that does add quite a bit of protein to it. The pancakes are made from Bob’s Red Mill Protein Pancake & Waffle Mix. It is a protein-packed whole grain mix that's easy to make. It’s packed with a hearty 15 grams of protein per serving!

This recipe works well with any type of dairy or plant based milk. I used unsweetened almond and it was still nice and creamy and delicious. Although this delicious goodness is totally dessert worthy, it's nutritious enough for breakfast.  The eggs provide quality protein while also creating a custard-like texture. It’s makes for a great, delicious and protein packed start to the day.

It's one thing to feed a crowd, it's another thing to please a crowd. Casseroles or baked french toasts like this one definitely do that and more. They are the perfect make ahead breakfast, making mornings a breeze. This is one I can enjoy because it’s dairy free and kind of a good for you breakfast. Something I can get behind. Although it's scrumptious straight from the oven, a little drizzle of maple syrup completes the experience. Whipped cream is also a great way to finish this off with too.
