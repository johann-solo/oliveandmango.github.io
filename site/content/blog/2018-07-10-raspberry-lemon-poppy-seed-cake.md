excerpt: A simple to make light and delicious poppy seed cake
---

It’s raspberry season here in Ontario and I’m dying to go pick some! I just went and picked some strawberries a few days ago and it was magical.  That may seem a little over dramatic but if you knew how long it’s been since I picked strawberries you would understand. It has been over 25 years if not more. I have bought market berries since then but nothing beats the experience of picking your own. What was exciting about it this time was seeing my husband experience it for the very first time. He brought his camera with him and the attitude of “how long is this going to take and let’s make it snappy”. Let’s just say by the time I started picking he had his own basket and was picking and eating his way through the patch! As soon as we got there he could smell the berries in the air and he couldn’t believe it. The air was sweet smelling and we couldn’t have picked a better day or time! It was golden hour and there was a beautiful breeze. Ideal picking conditions and photography conditions.

Market berries are fantastic but freshly picked are even more so. Johann kept deeply inhaling the air and the berries taking in their amazing aroma and each bite was followed with “oh man these taste like candy! These are sooo good!” We has a great time and he can’t wait to go back. We wanted to pick some raspberries but they weren’t quite ready yet so we will be back there soon for those and will definitely be making this cake again. It’s so delicious with the raspberries as they are the perfect mixture of sweet with a bit of tart which blends well with lemony flavours. The  lemony flavours also really go well with poppy seeds and thus this combo happened. This cake can be made with blueberries and strawberries and even cherries as well just a little FYI if you you were feeling it but with a different berry in mind.

This cake has so many delicious textures in it.  You get the light and delicious cake with subtle hints of coconut/vanilla and lemon and then you have a bit of crunch from the poppy seeds as well, then you have that jammy fruity part from the delicious raspberries and of course  a bit of crunch from the buttery sweet streusel topping - beautiful textures in each bite if you ask me. It’s not overly sweet at all and I really enjoyed this for breakfast too. It’s just one of those cakes that is totally light enough for brekkie (go ahead I won’t tell), great as a dessert with ice cream or a dollop of whip which is how I like it and perfect for afternoon tea!!

It’s also super simple to put together and also pretty quick to make. We loved it and also shared it with others who loved it as well. One of them being my sweet little nephew who I miss dearly! This was one of the last cakes I made while in Trinidad.  In fact I had some the last day we were at our apartment. I gave some to him and his mom and dad and he wanted to try some. So I warned him about the poppy seeds cause he had never had any before. I just told him it may be a little crunchy from some super special and yummy tiny seeds in the cake. He loved it but he started doing the cutest thing. He started picking out of his mouth every crunchy part and showing it to me and asking if that was the seed - which made me laugh so hard cause it was the cutest thing! You had to be there. Anyways this cake pleased a 5 year old so if it could do that you know there’s definitely something yummy about it. I know you will love it and it’s a great little cake to showcase your raspberries! Enjoy!
