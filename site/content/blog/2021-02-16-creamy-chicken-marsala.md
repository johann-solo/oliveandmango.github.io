<span class="blog-text">

This creamy chicken Marsala is a classic chicken dish that's creamy, quick, and irresistible. It’s packed with earthy mushrooms, smokey prosciutto, and perfectly tender chicken breast. The creamy sauce is made of mushrooms, marsala wine, and heavy cream and is irresistible. The marsala wine makes it slightly sweet and is what gives it it’s distinct flavour. I love it served over buttery noodles but it can be served with rice, mashed potatoes or with crusty bread.

## What is Chicken Marsala? 
Chicken Marsala is an Italian-American dish of lightly coated chicken breast cutlets that are pan-fried until golden and then braised with mushrooms in a rich one-pan Marsala wine sauce. Though it's a classic and beloved restaurant dish, it's really easy to make at home. This dish doesn’t traditionally contain cream or prosciutto in it but I decided to add both as the prosciutto adds a delicious layer of flavour to this dish and the cream makes it  extra rich and creamy.

## What is Marsala? 
Marsala is a fortified wine, either dry or sweet, produced in the region surrounding the Italian city of Marsala in Sicily. It’s most commonly used in cooking to create nutty, rich caramelized sauces like the delicious one in this dish. To substitute Marsala you could use sherry - it has a milder flavor, but in terms of cooking it will work. You can also use Port, Madeira wine or white wine - they will add a nice flavour but won’t taste the same as a classic chicken Marsala.

I partnered up with Metro Ontario to share a dish that pairs beautifully with wine in celebration of Drink Wine Day and I chose to share one of my favorite chicken dishes that not only pairs well with wine but is made in a delicious wine sauce. When it comes to pairing chicken Marsala it’s best not to go too big with this dish. I would avoid big bold reds like a Cabernet, Sangiovese or Zinfandel which will overpower not only the chicken, but also the subtle sweetness of the creamy Marsala sauce. You’re better off going with a full bodied white like a Chardonnay, or a light to medium bodied red like a Gamay, or Pinot Noir. I chose to serve mine with a local Niagara Peninsula VQA Farmstead Gamay wine by Malivoire as I always prefer a red over a white. It’s light and refreshing and not too overpowering. It was perfect with the chicken Marsala.

## How to Make Chicken Marsala
This simple recipe comes together quickly and in a few stages. Here’s all you need to do:
1.	Pound chicken breasts to approx ¼ inch thickness and dredge in the flour mixture. If your chicken breasts are particularly thick then it’s best to use 2 instead of four and you can slice them in half lengthwise. Brown the breasts on both sides in a hot pan stovetop then remove from pan and set aside. 
2.	For Sauce: In the same pan heat butter and add the prosciutto (if using) and cook until rendered and then add the mushrooms and garlic and continue cooking until mushrooms are nicely browned.
3.	Marsala Sauce: Deglaze the pan with the Marsala wine scraping up all the delicious brown bites from the bottom of the pan and then add the rest of the sauce ingredients and reduce. Place chicken back into pan and spoon over the sauce and serve sprinkled with chopped fresh parsley. Enjoy!

### Directions
1. Whisk together the flour and the seasoning spices in a shallow plate. 
1. Heat the oil over medium-high in a large skillet. When the oil is hot, dredge both sides of the chicken cutlets in the seasoned flour, shaking off the excess and place cutlets straight into the pan and pan fry for 3-5 minutes on each side until golden and cooked through. (doing this in batches if pieces don't fit comfortably in the pan and adding more oil as needed) Remove the chicken and set aside on large platter, tent with foil and keep warm. 
1. Lower the heat to medium and melt butter in pan and add prosciutto and sauté for 1 minute to render out some of the fat, scraping away at any of the leftover brown bits off the bottom of the pan. Then add the mushrooms and the garlic and saute until mushrooms are nicely browned, approx 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. 
1. Pour the Marsala into the pan and allow to simmer and reduce a few seconds to cook out the alcohol. Add the chicken stock and simmer  until reduced by half and starting to thicken, (about 10 minutes).
1. Stir in the cream and cook until sauce has thickened a little more 2-3 min. Return the chicken to the pan; simmer gently just enough  to heat the chicken through. Season with salt and pepper if needed and garnish with chopped parsley before serving.
