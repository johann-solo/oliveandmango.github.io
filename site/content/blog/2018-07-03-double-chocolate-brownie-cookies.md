These cookies take your favourite things about brownies and literally put them in each bite. That crackly top that everyone loves about brownies surrounds every surface of the cookie, minus that chewy rich and chocolatey centre.

It took a couple of recipes to find this gem of a recipe for these cookies. I came across this one from Food and Wine and loved it. Super easy, basic and I absolutely love how rich and chocolaty they are. You will understand what I mean when you see how much chocolate is in the recipe.

The chewiness factor is so perfect in these. So much so that I thought they made the most perfect ice-cream sandwiches. The were perfectly chewy and even when frozen are easy to bite through. I loved them with a scoop of plain vanilla ice-cream and a sprinkling of cocoa nibs for some extra crunch.

I made these with semi-sweet chocolate chips but you can definitely go bitter-sweet for more richness, less sweetness and a definite deep cocoa flavour. I had to put the batter back in the fridge after I scooped out my first tray but that was mainly because my apartment was so warm in Trinidad. If the dough gets too soft while scooping and organising them on the baking sheets just pop the bowl into the fridge or freezer for a few minutes and it will harden up and become easier to scoop out.

These are very simple to make and if you are a chocolate lover like I am you will adore these! I ate them with a sprinkling of flaky salt which helps intensify the the cocoa flavour even more and balances the sweetness. I always love a little salted sweetness but it’s totally optional. Hope you enjoy them!

<div>Servings: <span itemprop="recipeYield">Makes 30-36 medium sized cookies</div>
<div>Prep Time: <meta itemprop="prepTime" content="PT20M">15-20 mins</div>
<div>Inactive time: 1 hr while dough chills in the freezer</div>
<div>Cook Time: <meta itemprop="cookTime" content="PT12M">Each batch bakes for 10-12 min</div>
</br>

### Ingredients

* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 pound semisweet or bittersweet (for less sweet) chocolate, chopped (or 2&frac13; cups of chocolate chips)</span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 tablespoons unsalted butter</span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 large eggs, at room temperature</span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1½ cups sugar</span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">¼ teaspoon salt</span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">½ cup all-purpose flour</span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">½ teaspoon baking powder</span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">One 12-ounce bag semisweet chocolate chips/morsels ( 1 1/2 cups)</span>
</br>

### Directions
1. In a large bowl set over a saucepan of simmering water (double broiler) melt the chopped chocolate or chips with the butter, stirring a few times, until smooth, about 7 minutes.
2. In a small bowl whisk together the flour, baking powder and salt.
3. In another large bowl, using a handheld electric mixer, beat the eggs with the sugar at medium speed until thick and pale, about 5 minutes. Then beat in the vanilla.
4. Using a rubber spatula, fold in the melted chocolate until incorporated. Then fold in the flour mixture. Finally stir in the chocolate chips.
5. Scrape the dough off the sides of the bowl and cover bowl with plastic wrap and freeze until well chilled and firm, about 1 hour.
6. Preheat the oven to 350°F and line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.
7. Working in batches, scoop 2-tablespoon-size mounds of dough onto the prepared baking sheets, about 2 inches apart.
8. Bake for about 10-12 minutes, until the cookies are dry around the edges and crackly on top.
9. Let the cookies cool on the baking sheets for 10 minutes, then transfer to a rack to cool completely before serving.
10. The cookies can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 4 days.

### Recipe Notes
* It is CRITICAL to chill dough. It should be chilled enough that it’s easy to scoop out of bowl. Sticky but scoopable.
* If you want to make these less sweet I recommend using 1 pound of BITTERSWEET or even unsweetened baking chocolate for the chocolate being melted in the recipe.
* For the remaining chocolate chips in the recipe that get folded in, you can keep them as is - semi sweet or you can swap them out for toffee chips or peanut butter chips or even white chocolate chips for a change in flavour. Or you can also do dried fruit like dried cherries or cranberries.
