These pumpkin pancakes are light and fluffy with crispy edges and loaded with chocolate chips. They are my favorite fall pancakes. My preferred pancakes are always buttermilk ones for that extra rise. These not only have that but also have those warming fall flavours we all love so much. The pumpkin add a lovely fall flavor to these and that tone of orange we expect in anything pumpkin related. These are just such a treat to wake up to and your family will be happy you made them - just the most perfect breakfast with a hot cup of coffee on a cool fall morning!

## How to make pumpkin chocolate chip pancakes

These pumpkin chocolate chip pancakes are so easy to whip not unlike any other buttermilk pancake recipe. (Ps - if you don’t don’t have buttermilk - [make your own in a pinch](https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/homemade-buttermilk-3645761) together and mixing just until combined. The key to getting light and fluffy pancakes is to be sure that they don't over whisk the batter. Then you are ready to make your pancakes.  Heat up a skillet, pour out the batter, cook each side for a couple of minutes and keep stacking them.  Feel free to add the chocolate chips into the batter or sprinkle some of them onto the pancakes before you flip them while they are in the pan. Some people prefer making them this way to prevent the chips from melting or burning in the pan. I don’t mind them melting but I also wipe the pan before pouring a new batch of batter into the pan. Feel free to add a bit more butter or cooking spray into pan between batches too if needed.

I have made these pancakes with or without the chocolate chips and they are delicious either way. We love them with the chocolate chips though.  Those melty bits of chocolate are such a treat to bite into. Makes for a very special and sweet breakfast.  Feel free to make them with or without. I even like these pumpkin pancakes with blueberries if you can believe it. It just works trust me. They are perfect warm and with a dollop of whip cream, drizzles of maple syrup and we love ours with some toasted chopped pecan. No need to go out for a tasty pancake breakfast when it’s this easy to make a breakfast like that at home.

These pumpkin pancakes are the perfect thing to make if you have any leftover pumpkin purée from a previous recipe. They are definitely a good excuse to open a new can of purée too. Speaking of which you can make these with canned or with homemade pumpkin purée. I have included a simple recipe for homemade pumpkin purée below. It make a good amount so when I make it I usually freeze it. I measure out either ½ or 1 cup measurements and freeze them in 1 cup batches.

What I love about pancakes is that your can easily freeze them once you make a batch and you can enjoy them for breakfast later in the week. If you have leftover pancakes or just want to make breakfast in advance simply make your pancakes and let them cool, then store them in freezer-safe resealable bag. Take them out and defrost them in the toaster and enjoy. These are perfect year round but especially in the fall when we all seem to be craving pumpkin spiced flavors and cozy breakfasts. These tick off both those boxes and I know you will be hooked after you make your first stack. Enjoy!<br>

</br>

### Ingredients

* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 cups all-purpose flour	</span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">¼ cup sugar</span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2¼ teaspoons baking powder</span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">½ teaspoon baking soda</span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">½ teaspoon salt</span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tsp cinnamon</span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">½ tsp ground ginger</span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">¼ tsp nutmeg</span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 eggs</span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1½ cups buttermilk</span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">¾ cup pumpkin purée canned or homemade (my homemade recipe is below)</span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">¼ cup melted unsalted butter, plus some for pan </span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup chocolate chips (optional) *</span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">Serving suggestions: whipped cream and maple syrup and some chopped nuts </span>
</br>

### Directions

1. In a large bowl whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt and the spices
2. In a separate bowl whisk the eggs with the buttermilk, melted butter and the pumpkin purée. Combine the dry and the wet ingredients into a lumpy batter, being careful not to over mix and then mix in the chocolate chips.
3. Heat some butter in a skillet over medium heat. Spoon &frac13; cup of batter into the skillet and sprinkle and cook for 2 to 3 minutes on each side.
4. Serve with a dollop of whipped cream and maple syrup and a sprinkling of chopped nuts.
</br>

### Recipe note

Some people prefer adding the chocolate chips as they cook the pancakes to prevent them from melting in the pan. If you decide to make them this way simply make the batter without them in it, add the batter to the pan as instructed in recipe then sprinkle on some pancakes over the batter. They will sink into the batter and when you flip the pancakes over the chips won’t melt away into the pan as much.

## Homemade Pumpkin Purée

<div>Servings: <span itemprop="recipeYield">2 to 2½ pounds puree</div>
<div>Prep Time: <meta itemprop="prepTime" content="PT10M">20 mins</div>
<div>Cook Time: <meta itemprop="cookTime" content="PT20M">37 mins</div>
</br>

### Ingredients

1. 1 whole pumpkin 4-6 lbs or cut pumpkin pieces
1. Pinch of salt 
</br>

### Directions

1. Preheat oven to 400°F
2. Line one or two baking sheets with parchment paper
3. Slice pumpkin open and scoop out the seeds and fibers (reserve seeds for roasting or something else at another time) and cut up into 1-½ inch square pieces removing the skin
4. Arrange the pieces on baking sheet or sheets and sprinkle with salt and then roast them for 20-40 minutes until fork or knife can easily be inserted
5. Let sheetpan  cool on cooling rack until you pumpkin can be handled and then transfer it all to a food processor and process until the flesh is smooth. Store in the fridge for up to one week and freeze for up to 3 months.
6. You can also cut the whole pumpkin in half and roast pieces whole but this takes longer to roast and more work to scrape off the flesh from the skin after. I do both and result is the same it just depends on how much time I have on hand.
