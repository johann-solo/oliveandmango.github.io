## How to make granola bars

Skip the store-bought ones and opt for making your own granola bars. They are more delicious and couldn’t be easier to make.  Simply toast your oats and nuts or seeds for a few minutes. While they are toasting melt your butter, sugar and honey and then stir them into the oat mix. Incorporate the rest of your add-in ingredients and simply press the mixture firmly into a lined square baking pan. That’s the critical part. Take a minute and really press all the ingredients into the pan firmly. Refrigerate 2 hours until set and then slice and enjoy! They are satisfying, and just sweet enough.

## What can I add to my granola bars?

This super easy Granola Bar Recipe can be customized with your favorite add-ins. I love mine full of almonds and chocolate chips. If you wanted to go nut free feel free to use seeds for that extra bit of crunch in your bars.  When it comes to dried fruit I love the tangy sweetness that dried cranberries add but feel free to use raisins, dried cherries, apricots and even chopped dried figs or dates. Other nuts to use include peanuts, pistachios, cashews or hazelnuts. The possibilities are endless — all you need to know is the base. The staple ingredients that stay consistent are the oats, butter, honey and brown sugar. I often use maple syrup for honey or coconut sugar instead of brown sugar but other than that, those three things stay consistent. The honey and sugar not only provide sweetness but together with the butter are the glue that holds everything together. Chocolate chips or chunks are also a great option - totally a must in my books.

They are the perfect portable snack packed with flavor, crunch, and the right amount of chewiness in each bite. I love making them Sunday as part of my meal prep and they last the week between me and hubby. I let them set overnight and slice them up in the morning ready to enjoy for my mid morning snack.  They store well in airtight container for up to one week room temp for softer bars and for crunchier bars store them in the fridge. The combos are endless - hope you enjoy them.
