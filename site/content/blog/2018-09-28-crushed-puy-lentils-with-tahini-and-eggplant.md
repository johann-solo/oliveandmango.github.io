excerpt: A creamy and fragrant dip that makes the perfect starter

If you are a fan of hummus you will absolutely love this dip or spread that goes perfectly with roasted pita bread, crisps or toasted baguette. We inhaled this in one sitting. Just me and hubby - it’s that good!

It is so full of flavour from the garlic and cumin and garlic and has just the creamiest luscious texture from the eggplant, and tahini. The tomato and the lemon and cilantro boost the flavours a bit along with add a slight bite. It’s also so simple to make and made with very simple ingredients.

It’s a great vegetarian appetizer or if you are like me and hubby, it’s hearty enough to have as a light meal. It’s also a dish that we found comforting if that makes any sense. It’s warm and the texture is creamy and slightly chunkier than a hummus, a little deeper in flavour than hummus as well.

Its a fabulous meatless dish full of protein and naturally gluten free. Making this a very guilt-free comfort food that is appropriate for those with food sensitivities as well. You will love it and I strongly recommend you make some to snack on this weekend. Enjoy!

## Recipe
Serves 4
</br>
</br>

### Ingredients

* 1 cup small green Puy lentils (look for the smaller ones, sometimes called French lentils, not the regular ones)
* 1 medium sized eggplant
* 2 Tbsp unsalted butter
* 2 Tbsp olive oil
* 3 cloves garlic, crushed
* 1 tsp ground cumin
* 4 medium tomatoes peeled and diced (approx 2 cups)
* 1&frac23; cups of cilantro leaves
* &frac14; cup tahini paste
* 2 Tbsp lemon juice (I used juice from one lemon)
* salt and fresh ground black pepper to taste
* &frac13; small red onion, sliced very thinly

__To garnish__

* A hot smoked paprika, regular paprika, or sumac
* A good drizzle of olive oil


### Instructions

1. Bring a pot of water to a boil and add the lentils. 
2. Turn down the heat a bit and cook for about 30 minutes, or until the lentil are just cooked. Drain the lentils and set aside.
3. While the lentils are cooking, preheat the oven to 450°F. 
4. Place eggplant in a roasting pan or sheet pan. Roast the eggplant and turning halfway, until the skin has charred and the interior is very tender when pierced with a knife, approx 20 minutes. Let cool.
5. Peel and seed the cooled eggplant, and scrape the flesh out of the eggplant into a small bowl and set aside.
6. In a large skillet over medium/high heat melt the butter and add the olive oil. Add the garlic and cumin to the pan and stir for about a minute.
7. Add the chopped tomatoes to the pan, along with about &frac34; of the cilantro, the eggplant and the lentils. Stir to combine, and let it cook for a minute.
8. Stir in the tahini, lemon juice, 1 teaspoon of salt and lots of fresh ground pepper and approx 5 tbsps of water. 
9. Lower the heat to medium and cook gently, for about 5 minutes.
10. Roughly mash the lentils with a potatoes masher or wooden spoon (or you can transfer &frac13; of the mixture to a food processor and pulse a few time, return to pan and stir though the rest of the lentils) so that you get a thick porridge consistency.
11. Serve the lentils hot, sprinkled with the sliced onion and the rest of the cilantro. 
12. Drizzle with olive oil and dust with paprika. Eat with pita bread, crusty bread or seeded crackers
