This recipe is from a cookbook after my own heart. It’s from Love & Lemons Every Day by Jeanine Donofrio and Jack Mathews. There’s a few reasons I love this book - the obvious one is because I love my veggies and I mean all the veggies. Their recipes use very common  and simple to find ingredients that can be found mostly through the year at your local grocery store.  They use herbs and simple seasoning to add wonderful flavour and complexity to veggies. This dish is the perfect example. Plain roasted cauliflower with salt and pepper is paired with this lemon salsa verde which is made with a quick batch of preserved lemons, and garlicky miso cauli mash. You have yourself some complex and delicious flavours in this simple cauliflower dish.

Apart from that Jeff and Jeanine are a husband wife blogging duo like Johann and I and I can completely relate to her intro. I too am a peach lover like her (like so many others – I know), and I too succumb to falling into routine eating - green smoothie in the morning, avo toast for lunch and pho for dinner (we share a few things in common). That is why I love this book - it has given me some inspo for getting me out of my rut.  As a blogger who has a day job and doesn’t always cook to eat but many times cooks to shoot, and shoot for others - I don’t always eat the food we cook (my family does and thanks me for it). I sometimes can’t even eat what I cooked for the blog the same day - have you ever felt like that about the food you prepped and made? - you just lose your appetite a bit. So I resort to a lot of avo toasts and smoothies and I have the leftovers the day after. For some reason I can stomach the leftovers the next day. Anyways life is more than avo toasts and this book has given me some inspo for some simple meals I can prep and feel good about for everyday eating (esp on days when I don’t feel like eating the food I shot but want simple and delicious veggies meals that make me feel light on my feet) - cause lets be real homemade gnocchi and lasagna are not the usual in my midweek life.

Apart from the delicious recipes and beautiful photography, their are some pretty awesome features in this book. The recipes are clear and easy to follow and the book is divided into sections that make sense. The extra features include various ways to make simple meals and desserts - like 6 ways to scramble eggs, fruit crumbles 4 ways, 5 easy pasta favorites plus some super awesome guides. The guides include guides on grilling vegetables, building an epic snack board, how to freeze herbs properly, a two page spread on how to build your own salad dressing and so many great step by step pictures on how to make some of the recipes which I always love and find helpful. There is a great cocktail section and also a really cool tea-tail section in the book as well.  I’m dying to try her matcha mojito and the hibiscus highball. There is also a homemade extras section that includes a few basic vegan recipes that I can’t wait to try. I have her vegan pie crust on my list and I’m using her vegan ricotta in a recipe I am making this weekend.

This is a delicious dish from the book that I was happy to try and happy to say that my husband loved it and I definitely will be doing roasted cauliflower steaks a little more often. The quick preserved lemons are so handy and such a smart recipe from the book. The lemon salsa verde is made with the preserved lemons. I also love that there is absolutely no waste in this recipe. The whole cauliflower including the leaves are used in it. The cauli steaks are sliced close to the core. The core of the cauliflower holds the ‘steak’ together and then the rest of it is used to make the creamy cauliflower purée. Cauliflower always turns nutty and delicious when roasted and is a real treat to cut into and enjoy with this lemon salsa verde that is full of bright flavours. It’s great over the cauli steak and with any roasted veggies but would be great on simple pesto pastas as well. The cauli purée is creamy and garlicky with the hint of that wonderful miso flavour. You have all sorts of tastes and textures going on in this dish which adds to that nice ‘complexity’ I mentioned earlier in the post. It’s a great taste of what this book has to offer and I’m so looking forward to cooking from it more this weekend. Hope you enjoy the recipe and I fully recommend this book to everyone especially if you are looking for new, unique, and delicious ways to enjoy your veggies!

## Recipe
</br>

### Ingredients 

* <span itemprop="ingredients">1 medium cauliflower</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">2 garlic cloves</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">1 tablespoon white miso paste</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">1 tablespoon water, plus more as needed</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">Lemon zest, for garnish (optional)</span>

__Lemon Salsa Verde__

* <span itemprop="ingredients">3 tablespoons diced Quick Preserved Lemons</span> (recipe below)
* <span itemprop="ingredients">¼ cup finely chopped parsley or basil</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">2 teaspoons capers</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">2 tablespoons toasted pine nuts</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes and/or 1 tiny red chile pepper, thinly sliced</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</span>


### Directions 

1. Preheat the oven to 425°F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

2. Remove the coarse outer leaves of the cauliflower, then slice 4 (1-inch-thick) “steaks” from the middle of the cauliflower, keeping the core intact. This helps hold the steaks together.

3. Place the steaks on the baking sheet, drizzle with olive oil, and rub liberally on both sides with salt and pepper. Roast for 30 minutes, or until the core is fork-tender.

4. Break the remainder of the cauliflower into florets (about 2 cups) and bring a medium pot of salted water to a boil. Add the cauliflower florets and the garlic cloves and cook for 5 to 7 minutes, or until fork-tender. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the florets and garlic to a high-speed blender. Let cool slightly, and then add the olive oil, miso paste, lemon juice, and water.

5. Puree the mixture, using the blender baton to help keep the blade moving or pausing to stir as necessary. If needed, add 1 to 2 tablespoons more water to create a smooth puree. Season to taste.

6. Make the lemon salsa verde: In a medium bowl,combine the preserved lemons, parsley, capers, pine nuts, red pepper flakes, and pinches of salt and pepper. Stir in the olive oil.

7. Assemble each plate with a scoop of the cauliflower puree and a cauliflower steak. Top with the lemon salsa verde and garnish with the lemon zest, if desired. Season to taste with more salt and pepper and serve.
