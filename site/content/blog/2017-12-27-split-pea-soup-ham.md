excerpt: The most delicious way to use up leftover ham and that flavourful hambone
---

Baking a ham or a big ole turkey for that matter is such a rich reward. It’s really the gift that keeps on giving.  Not only is there left over meat from the two but the bones are perfect for soups. Have no fear if you’re hammed out the day after and can’t think of eating another bite.  I usually freeze some of the meat and I definitely freeze the ham bone to use at a later date and it’s usually to make this delicious split pea soup.

When using the frozen meat in something other than the soup I just thaw it in the fridge and I pan fry it to reheat with some of the reserved glaze. Oh yes I always reserve some glaze for leftovers.  It will keep at least a week in the fridge if not more.  If you saved leftover meat for the soup you don’t even need to thaw it - just throw it in frozen. When it comes to the ham bone I also don’t bother to thaw it. You can if you remember but if you are like me chances are you will forget or there’s not enough room in the fridge to thaw it in there overnight.

The bone gives the soup a fabulous flavour that ham alone can’t give. But what if you didn’t bake a ham? You can use smoked ham hocks and if you did save your bone but didn’t have any meat left than you can add any kind of ham in it. I even fry up some bacon or Pancetta and add it to the soup when I remove the bone for some extra meat, texture and flavour.

I used green split peas for the soup but you can use any split pea you like. I did the green ones cause I hadn’t seen them in a while at the grocery store and also love the slightly greenish hue they bring to the soup.

This is a very delicious way to use leftover meat from a baked ham. There are so many other ways to enjoy it along with the soup.  I love making into sandwiches, having it with eggs and toast and the list goes on.  To me the soup is the most satisfying way to eat those leftovers though. This is a super simple recipe for how I like to prepare mine and know you will love it.

### Ingredients

* 8 cups of water or broth (I like to use chicken or vegetable stock for extra flavour)
* 1 large ham bone
* 2 cups dried green split peas
* 2 large carrots peeled and chopped
* 2 celery ribs chopped
* 2 onions chopped
* 3 cloves of garlic minced
* 2 small green onions/chives chopped 
* 4 sprigs of fresh thyme (use approx 1 tsp of dry alternatively)
* 2 bay leaves
* Salt and pepper to taste
<br>

### Directions

1. Rinse your peas with cold water and add to a large heavy bottom pot along with 8 cups of water or broth.  Bring to boil and then remove pot from heat, cover and let sit for 45 minutes to 1 hour

1. Return to heat and bring to a boil again. Then add the ham bone, carrots, celery, onions, garlic, thyme, bay leaves and green onions. Reduce heat to a simmer, cover and cook for approx 1 to 1 1/2 stirring occasionally.

1. Remove the ham bone and any large pieces of meat from soup and set aside, remove bay leaves and sprigs of thyme and discard.

1. Use an immersion blender to blend parts or all of the soup if you want it to have a creamy texture. I usually leave it as is. Taste and adjust for salt and pepper. Feel free to add more water our broth if soup is too thick just make sure to heat through if adding more liquid

1. Cut off any pieces of meat from ham bone and cut or shred into bite sized pieces and return the meat to the soup. Discard the ham bone.

1. Serve soup and enjoy. I topped mine with buttered toast and I pan fried some of the extra ham pieces so that they were extra crispy and I topped the soup with a few of the crispy pieces.
