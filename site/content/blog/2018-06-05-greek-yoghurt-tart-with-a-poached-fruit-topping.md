excerpt: A tart that is light, delicious and perfect as a dessert but can also double as breakfast

How fabulous is it to be able to serve a tart for dessert that is healthy enough to enjoy for breakfast too. This is one of those tarts. It’s perfect as a light dessert and also perfect for brunch or breakfast too.

The base is a lovely blend of oats and nuts sweetened with maple syrup. It’s baked for a short time which helps it keep it’s integrity. It itself is so delicious and so fragrant when baking. The original recipe calls for a mix of hazelnut and almonds but feel free to use one or the other to make up the full amount. The addition of the citrus is wonderful. It doesn’t overpower but adds a nice bright note to the crust and the filling. It would work just as well with lemon or lime if your prefer.

The filling is made with a whipped Greek yoghurt, sweetened with powdered sugar but you most definitely can add in maple syrup or honey to sweeten if you would want to keep it refined sugar free. You can also sub vanilla yoghurt and sweeten to taste which saves you some time as well.

Let’s talk about that delicious topping. Pomerac also known as rose apple, Jamaican apple or more commonly Otaheite Apple is a very unique fruit who’s flesh is kind of spongy in texture. It has a very subtle sweetness with a hint of tartness. It resembles the shape of a pear with a bright red or pinkish very thin exterior that does not need to be peeled to eat. My mother In law was visiting and got her hands on some and had a few left over before she left that she handed off to me which I happily accepted.

I wanted to make a little something different with them instead of just eating them as is or making them into chow (pickled). I was seeing a lot of rhubarb in my IG feed and was missing it and then it clicked - the two are by no means similar in texture but thy are similar in colour and also similar in the fact that they both have some tartness associated to them and are perfect for poaching. I had a bottle of ice wine sitting waiting to be opened and I thought it would be perfect for poaching the pomerac in. Wine in general is wonderful for poaching fruit and the ice wine has an extra bit of sweetness and concentrated flavour. You can sub the ice wine with any white or rosé fruity wine or a non alcoholic one. You can also just sub it with water if you don’t want any other flavour in the topping.

The pomerac is very much interchangeable with rhubarb and also perfect with stone fruit and berries as well so feel free to use the poaching liquid with any of those yummy fruits.

Assembling the tart is super easy but very important to remember that the crust layer although baked is still very porous and the yoghurt is very much wet even when you use a thick Greek yoghurt. If you put it together and refrigerate say overnight - it will be a little soppy (think overnight oats). So I very much recommend making each component ahead of time and putting it together right before serving. That way the crust stays crisp and delicious. Any leftovers are perfect especially for brekkie. It’s just like having oats, yoghurt and stirred fruit. Totally delicious!

This tart will be on repeat all summer long - and if you can get your hands on some pomerac (I’m seeing them in market shots that my Trini friends are posting) definitely try poaching them for this topping or over ice-cream or on your breakfast oats and yoghurt. You will love it and this tart.

### Ingredients

__For the crust__

* 1 cup hazelnuts
* 1 cup almonds
* &frac12; cup oats
* 2 tbsp coconut oil melted
* &frac12; an orange zested and juiced
* &frac13; cup pure Maple syrup or honey
* 1 heaped tbsp raw cacao or very dark cocoa powder

__For the yoghurt filling__

* 2 cups Greek yoghurt (or vegan yoghurt)
* &frac14; cup confectioners sugar (a few tbsp of maple syrup as an alternative)
* 1 teaspoon fresh orange juice
* &frac12; teaspoon grated orange zest
* &frac34; teaspoon pure vanilla extract


Whisk together yoghurt, confectioners sugar, orange juice, zest, and vanilla, until well combined and set aside until ready to put tart together
</br>
</br>

__For the pomerac or rhubarb topping__

* 3 cups of pomerac or rhubarb (stone fruit and berries can also be subbed) cut into approx 1 inch pieces
* &frac12; cup Ice wine, port, sherry or sweet wine of choice (or non alcoholic wine or water if you prefer no other flavour in the poaching liquid)
1 cup sugar
* 1 cup water
* 1 tsp vanilla extract
* 1 tsp orange zest
* 5 whole black peppercorns

### Directions

1. Place the port, sugar, water, vanilla, orange zest, and peppercorns in a medium pot and cook over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until the sugar dissolves and the mixture just begins to boil.

1. Add the pomerac and cook until just slightly tender, about 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from the heat and let it cool in the poaching liquid. (If you want a thicker syrup see notes below)
2. Place the hazelnuts and almonds in a food processor and process until they resemble a fine, crumb texture.
3. Add the oats and process the mixture again for a few seconds.
4. Add the melted coconut oil, orange juice and zest, pure Maple syrup and the cacao powder. Pulse the mixture until fully combined.
5. Press the mixture into a tart case measuring approx. 14" x 5" and 1" deep.  Ideally, one with a loose bottom to make it easier for removing the tart but if you do not have a loose bottomed one, you can line your tart tin with baking paper. 
6. Use your fingers to smooth off the edges of the mixture and press down with the underside of a spoon to ensure it is all even and compact.
7. Place the base in the oven and bake for 10 minutes in a preheated oven at 350&deg;.
8. Remove the base from the oven and allow to cool completely before adding the next layer. Once cool and if not serving immediately – wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate until you are ready to assemble it. 
9. Only add the yoghurt layer of the tart when you are ready to serve, otherwise, it will make the base soggy.  Simply spoon the yoghurt into the base and smooth over with a spoon until all even.
10. Add several pieces of the slices of the Pomerac and syrup and scatter with a few mint leaves before serving immediately.

### Recipe Notes
__For thicker syrup__: Spoon out the pomerac with a slotted spoon and continue to simmer the poaching liquid until reduces and a little more syrupy – approx 10 minutes. Remove from heat return the pomerac to pot and allow it to cool before using it and if making a head before refrigerating.
