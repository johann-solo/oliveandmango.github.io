You guys know how much I love olive oil. Especially a very good quality one. Good olive oil, real olive oil, should smell and taste green, bright, peppery, earthy, grassy, or any combination thereof. That is exactly what _Kalikori_ tastes like. It has a distinctive green colour and a peppery finish, moderately intense aromatic notes reminiscent of spring herbs and the Mediterranean sun. I love what it does to food, of course, but I also love it in baked goods. It gives a [wonderful flavour and texture to cakes](https://www.oliveandmango.com/vegan-chocolate-olive-oil-cake-with-olive-oil-frosting/); it gives [cookies](https://www.oliveandmango.com/salted-olive-oil-chocolate-chunk-cookies-with-almonds/) a little something special too!

The olive oil doesn’t just bring its distinct flavour to the mousse, it creates its smooth, soft, pillowy texture that is creamy yet light and frothy. Along with the olive oil this mousse has some very classic eggnog flavours in it. It’s got the eggs, sugar, cream, booze and nutmeg. The white chocolate gives it a rich quality to it that I love. I used _Nigella Lawson’s_ recipe for olive oil chocolate mousse as a basis for the recipe but I had to switch several things up as white chocolate responds a little differently due to fat content, it’s also more sensitive to high heat and sweeter than dark chocolate.

This is a wonderful light but decadent dessert that is it lightly spiced and boozy, with a delicious smooth hint of peppery flavour from the olive oil. If you have never made mousse with olive oil you must give it a go. You will love it.

Serves 4-6 depending on the size of ramekins you use
</br>
</br>

### Ingredients

* <span itemprop="ingredients">3.5 ounces best quality white chocolate</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">¼ cup <span class="highlight"><a rel="nofollow" href="http://kalikori.com">Kalikori</a></span> extra virgin olive oil</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">2 large eggs, separated</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">¾ heavy whipping cream</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">1 tablespoon sugar</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">&frca14; teaspoon salt</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">&frca12; tsp of grated nutmeg plus more for dusting </span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">&frca12; tsp vanilla extract </span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">2 tbsp of rum or bourbon, optional</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">Extra white chocolate, grated for garnishing</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">Extra whip cream for garnish</span>

Note: the egg yolks are whisked over a Bain-Marie in this recipe, but that doesn’t necessarily “cook” them. If you are concerned about the eggs not cooking enough to destroy bacteria, [pasteurize them first](https://www.thespruceeats.com/pasteurize-eggs-in-the-microwave-995505).

### Directions

1. Beat the cream until soft peaks form and set aside.

2. In a heat-proof, glass bowl, beat the egg yolks, nutmeg and the sugar over a pot of simmering water with a whisk, until the mixture is thick and glossy (about 3-5 minutes or so).

3. Place the chocolate in a bowl and microwave for 20 seconds at a time, stirring in between until the chocolate has completely melted. Whisk in the olive oil until smooth. 
4. Add the salt to the melted chocolate and whisk it into the hot, egg yolk mixture. Then whisk in the vanilla extract and rum if using. Set it aside to cool slightly. 

5. In another bowl, beat the egg whites until stiff.

6. Fold the whipped cream into the egg white mixture, then fold the chocolate and egg yolks into the fluffy whites and cream mixture.

7. Pour the mousse into either one large bowl or in 4-6 small ramekins or glasses then refrigerate until set. If it’s in smaller dishes it should take approx 1-2 hours, and the larger dish can take appox 4 hours.
