Every season should include a cocktail. Truly nothing says Fall better than apples and spice and so I thought this apple cider based cocktail is the perfect autumnal cocktail and thereâ€™s bourbon in it folks so you know itâ€™s going to be good! Iâ€™m thinking up some winter ones too. Winter ones are my favourite as the season is full of citrus, not to mention cranberries and pomegranate. I love citrus cocktails so stay tuned! In the meantime the recipe for this cocktail is below.
