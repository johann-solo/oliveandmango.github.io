Pasta is one of those dishes that is fabulous for a quick mid week meal.  Pasta with pesto is on rotation pretty much every week in our house. It’s delicious, low effort and you literally can add anything else you want into it.

This is one of my favourite ways to eat pasta. Going to East side Mario’s was a thing growing up. A big group of us friends would have lots of laughs and some mediocre food with endless amounts of bread and their salad - oh goodness that salad! I would always order the same thing. Either the cheese cappelletti or the vegetable primavera, and I would gorge on their salad all evening! Well this dish reminded me of the veggie pasta I always use to get there. The veggies in this dish are roasted and nutty flavoured and fabulous. Roasting the veggies makes all the difference. I’m sure the veggies at the restaurant were probably steamed. No matter though.

The addition of the pesto takes this pasta dish from good to great.  Adds so much flavour and a lot more colour. This is such a great staple recipe that keeps all in the family happy and doubles as a great cold pasta salad the next day.  It’s also a very versatile recipe. You can sub in different veggies - whatever you may have on hand to make it a clean-out-the-fridge kind of pesto pasta dish.  It works really well for that.  Whatever you decide to add or substitute veggie-wise, I’m sure you will be happy with it! It’s just one of those dishes that everyone loves!
