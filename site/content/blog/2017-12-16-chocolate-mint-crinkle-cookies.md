excerpt: Dark chocolate mint addictive flavour bombs
---

I have never made these crinkle cookies before but have had them many times. We had a patient at one of the offices I use to work at back home who use to bake and bring them in for us girls and I loved them and since I moved here I haven’t had any nor have I thought about them. That is until I received a big bunch of fresh mint. I wondered what to do with it. I used a lot of it in my fasolatha and I also made some cocktails using it too. But then I remembered these moist chewy cookies that I adored and couldn’t get enough of and started to search my way through dozens of recipes on how to incorporate fresh mint into them and then also try to locate a solid basic crinkle cookie recipe too, and this is what I came up with.

Why use fresh mint instead of peppermint extract? Excellent question. Before I attempted to try using the fresh I did the rounds to all the groceries and specialty shops and could not find some. This was before the holiday season though. Now I have found some at 3 different places and needless to say stocked up on a bottle or two of it. I prefer to use pure extract not just a mint or vanilla essence. It makes a huge difference in flavour and taste and the quality of baked goods you use it in. That is the first reason, and the second reason was purely a want to experiment and use the whole lot of fresh mint I had just received.

Many recipes call for getting the flavour and oils from the mint and then discarding it, but there was one that used the whole darn thing and I thought that was brave and wonderful so that is what I did! The amazing thing about it is that when you process the sugar and mint together they become one. It seems like the oils melt through the leafy bits of it and you are left with a green dusty sugar. It’s amazing and there are no chunks of mint in the cookies. You end up with intense peppermint chocolate crinkle cookie bombs of flavour.  Mint bursting into each bite you take.  Chewy delicious rich chocolate flavored cookies.

I took them to a little gathering not knowing what to expect and everyone loved them.  They served them on their own and with ice cream and they were awesome with the ice cream. I strongly recommend it in fact. Whichever way you make them with the fresh mint or extract I know you will enjoy these cookies. One thing I did notice when using the fresh mint and I thought it was kind of cool although subtle – if you look closely enough you will notice that a very slight green tone pushes through the sugar. You are using fresh mint after all!!

They are like a rich chocolatey fudgey After eight thin mints or sticks. You all know what I mean.  Those sticks of mint chocolate that I use to roll my eyes at when someone would come over for dinner at my parents house and would bring them as a host gift. Then I would find myself days later watching tv and eating the whole box of them cause you just can’t stop at one. These are just as addictive.  You have one and then you just keep going back for more!! Definitely add them to your cookie list – you will love them and how surprisingly simple they are to make!

## Recipe
Makes aprox. 30-36 cookies if using tablespoon per cookie
</br>
</br>

### Ingredients

* 1&frac12; cups all purpose flour
* &frac12; cup unsweetened cocoa powder
* 2 tsp baking powder
* &frac12; tsp salt
* 1 whole stick of butter, softened
* &frac34; cup brown sugar
* 1 cup very loosely packed fresh mint leaves (alternatively 1 tsp of pure peppermint extract)
* 2 large eggs
* 8 ounces semisweet chocolate
* 1 tsp pure vanilla extract
* &frac12; cup granulated sugar
* 1 cup powdered sugar
<br>

### Directions

1. Preheat oven to 350 &deg; F when ready to roll the cookies

1. In a large bowl whisk together the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder and salt and set aside

1. Place the sugar and mint in a food processor and blend until the mixture resembles green wet coarse sand (skip this step if using peppermint extract)

2. In a medium saucepan over low heat melt the butter and the semi-sweet chocolate stirring often. REMOVE from heat when melted and transfer to a large mixing bowl then add the mint sugar mixture or peppermint extract and then the vanilla and the eggs whisking the mixture vigorously to incorporate them.

3. Add and stir in a third of the dry ingredients into the chocolate mixture. Repeat until all the dry ingredients have been incorporated. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for an hour until firm, or overnight if making ahead.

4. Remove the dough from the refrigerator and line a baking sheet with parchment paper

5. Place the granulated sugar and powdered sugar in two separate bowls near the bowl of cookie dough. Scoop one tbsp of the dough into your hand, roll and shape it into a ball and place on a plate. Repeat with all the remaining dough.

6. Roll each ball into the granulated sugar first and then roll them into the powdered sugar to coat well.

7. Place them on a baking sheet approx 1-2 inches apart and bake them for 10-12 minutes until the cookie tops begin to split. Remove from oven and cool in pan for a few minutes and then transfer cookies from pan to cooling rack.

8. Cookies will keep in an airtight container for approx 1 week
