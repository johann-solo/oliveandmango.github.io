These double chocolate mint crinkle cookies have an irresistible brownie textured centre, with crisp crackly edges.  They are a classic cookie that everyone loves. They are also simple to make and delicious whether you use fresh mint in them or peppermint extract. They have a striking appearance with the contrast of white and chocolate from them cracking, creating deep chocolatey crags. I first had these years ago. We had a patient’s mom at an office I worked at bring in her homemade batch of these for the staff to enjoy and we all couldn’t get enough of them. I have since lost that recipe probably between moves over the years but tested a few of them until I got this one. It’s easy and delicious.

I originally made these using fresh mint as I made them while I was living in Trinidad and I couldn’t find peppermint extract anywhere. Of course I found it months after and made another batch but not when I needed it - that is why I have included the easy instructions for making it with fresh mint or extract. Many recipes call for getting the flavour and oils from the fresh mint and then discarding it, but there was one that used the whole darn thing and I thought that was brave and wonderful so that is what I did! The amazing thing about it is that when you process the sugar and mint together they become one. It seems like the oils melt through the leafy bits of it and you are left with a green dusty sugar. It’s amazing and there are no chunks of mint in the cookies. You end up with intense peppermint chocolate crinkle cookie bombs of flavour. Mint bursting into each bite you take.  One thing I did notice when using the fresh mint and I thought it was kind of cool although subtle – the end up with a very slight green toner that  pushes through the sugar. You are using fresh mint after all!!

These are always a hit and are also great with ice cream. I took a batch of them over to a friends house one evening and the came up with that combo. They thought these tasted like brownie bites and served them in a dessert bowl with a scoop of ice cream and It was a genius and delicious idea. These are perfectly soft, tender and chewy and they have a rich chocolate flavor. Out of the oven they melt in your mouth. They are like a rich chocolatey fudgey After eight thin mints or sticks. You have one and then you just keep going back for more!! Definitely add them to your cookie list – you will love them and how surprisingly simple they are to make!

Tips on making perfect crinkle cookies every time:

* Measure dry ingredients accurately 
* Make sure to chill the dough - chilled dough is easier to roll 
* Make sure to roll the balls in granulated sugar first then in the powdered sugar (The first layer ensures that the second one retains its snowy white appearance.)

### Ingredients

* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1½ cups all purpose flour</span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">½ cup unsweetened cocoa powder</span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tsp baking powder</span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">½ tsp salt</span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 whole stick of butter, softened</span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup brown sugar</span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tsp of pure peppermint extract or 1 cup very loosely packed fresh mint leaves</span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tsp pure vanilla extract</span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 large eggs</span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">8 ounces semisweet chocolate, melted</span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">½ cup granulated sugar</span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup powdered sugar</span>
</br>

### Directions

1.	In a large bowl whisk together the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder and salt and set aside
2.	Place the sugar and mint in a food processor and blend until the mixture resembles green wet coarse sand (skip this step if using peppermint extract)
3.	In a large bowl using a hand-held mixer or stand mixer beat the butter and the the brown sugar (infused or plain), together on medium high speed until fluffy and creamed, about 2 minutes. Beat in eggs, vanilla, and the peppermint extract. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl as needed.
4.	Beat in the melted chocolate 
5.	Mix in the dry ingredients into the chocolate mixture gradually until fully incorporated. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for one hour until firm, or overnight if making ahead. (If making it overnight, let stand a few minutes before scooping out)
6.	Preheat oven to 350°F. Line two large baking sheets with parchment paper and set aside
7.	Place the granulated sugar and powdered sugar in two separate bowls near the bowl of cookie dough. Scoop and roll balls of dough, approx 1.5 Tablespoons of dough each, into balls. Roll each ball very lightly in granulated sugar, then generously in the confectioners’ sugar. Place each roll 2-3 inches apart on the baking sheets.
8.	Bake the cookies for 11-12 minutes. If the cookies aren’t really spreading by minute 9, remove them from the oven and lightly bang the baking sheet on the counter 2-3x. This helps initiate that spread. Return to the oven for a couple more minutes. 
9.	Cool cookies for 5 minutes on the baking sheet, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
10.	Cookies will stay fresh covered at room temperature for up to 1 week.

### Recipe Notes

* These cookies freeze well, either unbaked or baked. Freeze  unbaked balls of dough without powdered sugar on a sheet pan until solid, then transfer to a freezer bag or container. Let the dough balls thaw for a few minutes on the counter while the oven pre-heats, then roll in granulated sugar and powdered sugar and bake. You may need to add an extra minute or two to the baking time.
