These Double Chocolate Coconut Banana Muffins are perfect for any time of day. Delicious, light banana muffins, studded with chunks of chocolate and shredded coconut. If you are like me and always seem to have some over ripe bananas hanging around needing to be be baked into something delicious - these muffins are just the thing.

Plain and simple they are delicious and what also makes them so darn good is the fact that they are easy to make. I love the dark chocolate chunks in them too. They are not overpoweringly chocolatey or coconutty and the banana is mellow in them too. They are a delicious balanced combination of flavours. They are moist and chocolatey especially since I like using chocolate chunks instead of chips in this recipe ensuring that each bite has a decent amount of chocolates in it. If you can't find the chocolate chunks to use, maybe consider getting a block of semi or bittersweet chocolate and cutting in to chunks instead otherwise chocolate chips will also work.

## Why you will love these muffins
* You will love these for how moist and delicious they are and they are also great for making the night before for breakfast or brunch the next day. 
* They are loaded with rich chocolate flavours 
* They are very simple to make. 
* They also freeze well so you can freeze some to enjoy later.

## How to make these Chocolate Coconut Banana Muffins
* Make the muffins batter
* Whisk together the dry ingredients except for the sugar. 
* Mash the banana in a separate bowl (I like to use a potato masher) then mix with the sugar, eggs, oil, coconut milk and vanilla extract until well combined, light and fluffy.
* Slowly mixing in the dry ingredients into the wet until just mixed through - a few streaks of flour through the batter is fine.
* Do not overmix.
* Stir in the chocolate chunks.

## Fill the muffin cups

* Pour batter or scoop it out (I like to use a cookie scoop) into a prepared muffin pan with liners in the wells - fill each well just below the edge of the pan. 
* Sprinkle the tops with more chocolate chunks and some coconut chips. 

## Bake the muffins

* Place them in the oven and bake the muffins for about 25-27 minutes or until a tester comes out clean then allow them to cool a few minutes in the pan and enjoy. I love mine warm, sliced in half with a little butter (regular or almond) smeared on them.

</br>
</br>

### Directions

1. Preheat oven to 350°F and place your muffin liners in the muffin tin
1. In a small mixing bowl whisk together the flour, desiccated coconut, cocoa powder, baking soda and pinch of salt and set aside
1. In separate large bowl mash the bananas and then mix in (I use a mixer to do this) the eggs, sugar, oil, coconut milk and vanilla extract until well combined, light and fluffy.
1. Slowly add the dry ingredients to the wet and mix until just combined. Using a spatula to scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl ensuring everything is mixed well (do not OVERMIX) and then stir in the chocolate chunks
1. Scoop out the batter evenly between the 12 cups in the tin (I go right to the top), top with a little more chopped chocolate and the toasted coconut and then bake for 25 minutes or until tester inserted in them comes out clean
1. Allow to cool for 10 minutes in pan before serving.
1. Cover leftover muffins is airtight container and store at room temperature for 5 days or in the refrigerator for 1 week. Muffins freeze well for up to 3 months. Thaw in the refrigerator or on the counter.

### Recipe Notes
* Oil: Vegetable oil, canola oil, work best in this recipe instead of the coconut oil. 
* Milk: I like to use coconut milk in this recipe but you can use buttermilk or whole milk. You can use any milk, dairy or nondairy, but the lower fat milk you use, the less flavorful and moist your muffins will taste.
* Chocolate Chunks: I love using chocolate chunks or chopped baking chocolate. But you can use chocolate chips mini or regular or a combination of both chips and chunks too. 
* To freeze, either wrap them individually in a layer of plastic wrap under a layer of aluminum foil or put them in a zippered bag with the date on it and pop them in the freezer
