This giant Chocolate Chip Raspberry Skillet Cookie has crispy edges and a chewy and gooey centre - truly the best of both worlds. Pulled hot from the oven, this baby is totally molten in the centre and begging for a scoop or two of vanilla bean ice cream. It’s big enough to share, but (dangerously) delicious enough to eat alone. Spoon this warm treat straight out of the pan or cut it into wedges and serve with your favourite ice cream.

I felt the need to make a recipe with raspberries after I did a white chocolate and currant recipe so I decided on this one and instead of pairing them with white chocolate as I usually do, I went with semi sweet. This is a very very decadent skillet cookie as you can see from the amount of butter and sugar in it. It’s just the best treat and I have to say it wasn’t easy to photograph without wanting to dig into it with my spoon.  You will feel the same way after it comes out of the oven.

I used some spelt flour in my version of this recipe but feel free to use all-purpose. I love that it adds a nuttiness to whatever it’s baked into and I also had some to use up - I’m glad I did. I loved it in this skillet cookie. Another thing I added which I love to add into cakes and other baked goods is instant vanilla pudding powder. This too is optional but I love what it does to baked goods. Adding it increases the hydration in the batter of whatever you are baking and increases that chew factor.  It’s completely optional - the change in texture is minutely different especially in this skillet cookie which is quite chewy and molten-like on its own. It also has a leavening affect - there’s a whole chemistry behind adding it which I don’t really understand but a lot of bakeries and bakers add it in for the very reasons I mentioned above.

I really can’t say enough about this dessert! My friends and family loved it and it was gone super fast. Bring this crowd-pleasing dessert to the table with plenty of extra spoons and watch it disappear before your eyes!

* <span itemprop="ingredients"> 1 cup brown sugar</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients"> &frac12; cup white sugar</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients"> 2 large eggs</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients"> 1 tsp vanilla extract</span> 
* <span itemprop="ingredients"> &frac34; cup all-purpose flour</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients"> &frac14; cup spelt flour (if you don’t have any just replace with all-purpose flour)</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients"> 1 tsp baking powder</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients"> A pinch of salt </span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients"> 1 tbsp of instant vanilla pudding powder (optional) </span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients"> 200g dark chocolate, chopped</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients"> &frac12; cup frozen or fresh raspberries</span>

### Directions

1. Preheat your oven to 350°F and grease a 23 cm cast iron skillet butter. You can also line the bottom of the skillet with parchment paper as well making it easier to slice and serve. 
2. In a small bowl whisk together the flour, baking powder and pinch of salt and set aside. 
3. In a medium bowl or stand mixer, cream butter and sugars together until light in colour and fluffy. Scrape down bowl and add eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Add vanilla extract and mix again to combine.
4. Add the vanilla pudding and mix in and then add half of the flour mixture and mix on low speed for about 10 seconds, until just incorporated. Add the remaining half the flour mixture, mixing again on low speed for about 10 seconds.
5. Add all but a tbsp or so of the chopped chocolate, reserving some bigger pieces for sprinkling on top, and fold into the batter.do the same with the raspberries,reserving a few to top 
6. Scrape the cookie dough out and into the cast iron skillet, smoothing the top down. The dough should reach about 1cm (&frac12; inch) below the rim of the skillet, otherwise it may overflow.
7. Scatter over the remaining chocolate and the raspberries. 
8. Bake the skillet cookie for 25-30 minutes, it should look puffed and golden brown with a gooey centre. Leave to cool for at least 20 minutes, before serving warm with ice cream.
