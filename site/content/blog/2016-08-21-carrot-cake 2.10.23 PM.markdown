What's the best thing about carrot cake? The cream cheese frosting!! Am I right!?!? I love a moist carrot cake with a little crunch and not to much add ons. Save the raisins and pineapple for another cake (My hubby would pick each and every one of them out). Bring on the pecan or walnuts though. At least that's how I like mine. I have tried several recipes but a few years ago I found a total winner courtesy of Ree Drummond (Sigrid's Carrot Cake recipe). No surprise, her recipes never disappoint.  
<br>

This one in particular is so simple and comes out perfect every time. No crazy ingredients that I have to hunt down and then never use again and get lost in the pantry. Just your basic flour, carrots, oil, eggs.....you get the picture. I'm a butter fan when it comes to baking but really it's the oil that gives this cake and all cakes made with oil their moistness and keeps the cake light at the same time. That's really what you want in a cake, otherwise it's more like a bread.

The only thing I modify when I make it is that I don't bake it in Bundt pan. I bake it in two 9 inch cake pans and layer it with frosting in the middle and a nice slathering on top. It ends up looking rustic chic!  If you do like the add ins, this recipe definitely allows for them. So feel free to toss in some raisins, sultanas, currants, coconut shavings and pineapple to taste.

The change in pan makes for a change in time in the oven. I split the batter between the two pans and baking time is 30-35 minutes depending on your oven, which is different form the original recipe using a Bundt and baking for 50 minutes.

It's great for dinner parties, and potlucks. It's a crowd pleaser for sure. The best part is that it's easy to make, it comes out deliciously moist every time and hey, you get a little veg in your dessert to! Give it a try and tell me what you think and if you have a favorite recipe for this classic!
