## How to make baked French toast?
Baked French toast is a favorite in our house and me make it almost every long weekend. It’s easy to make. All you need are basic ingredients to make it. You cut up day old bread, place it in a buttered dish then whisk up a quick custard to pour over. You can top it with fruit or a crumble or leave as is and then bake until the edges are golden and crisp.

## What bread to use in baked French toast? 
The choice is really yours. A yeasted bread like [tsoureki](https://www.oliveandmango.com/tsoureki-greekstyle-sweet-brioche-bread-sweet-mahlab-bread/), brioche or challah yields heartier, thick French toast. Yeasted breads usually have some sugar and eggs added to the dough already so you get a richer taste and denser interior. It tends to be more of a custardy baked  French toast. The same goes for croissant or babka French toasts. Make sure and check out my [croissant French toast recipe](https://www.oliveandmango.com/croissant-baked-french-toast-with-strawberries-and-cream-cheese/) as well.  Crusty French bread or sourdough loaves can also be used for a less sweet and lighter texture with very crispy edges. Cutting the bread into smaller pieces allows it to soak up more of the custard. Whatever you choose to use will be delicious. The key is to make sure it’s day old bread for the best texture. Feel free to toast or dry it out on a sheet Pan in the oven on low heat for a few minutes. This will help prevent a soggy bottomed baked French toast.

## How to make the custard for baked French toast
The custard is basically eggs and milk or cream and I always love to add flavor to mine by adding either vanilla extract or almond extract and some spices. I also include either sugar, honey or maple syrup to add a bit of sweetness. Whisk everything together really well and then this is the mixture you dip your bread into if using slices and what you pour over your bread after it’s in the dish.

## What can I add to my French toast? 
The options are truly endless. I love adding berries. But you can add other things too like a bit of pumpkin purée (&frac12; cup) to your custard or even sweetened cream cheese (6 ounces) in between layers to have pockets of creaminess in your French toast or even fruit preserves. You can also add chocolate chips and nuts (&frac12; cup) to it too. Feel free to get creative. When it comes to toppings I kept this one simple with sliced almonds but when I do my [crusty bread version](https://www.oliveandmango.com/baked-blueberry-french-toast/) I do a streusel topping over it and it’s just the best. Once you have your French toast in order in your dish the key to getting it the perfect texture is to cover it and let it set in the fridge for 1 hour or even up to overnight making this a great thing to prep the night before you want to serve it.

It comes together so quickly and is such a treat to enjoy for breakfast or brunch. It’s customizable and leftovers can easily be reheated in the oven or pan fried in a bit of butter the next day. We serve it with a dusting  of powered sugar and maple syrup. But it’s great with whip cream as well and extra fruit on these side. Hope you enjoy it!
