This is a very simple to make skillet cookie recipe that incorporates some signature fall flavours in it. Warming pumpkin pie spices, pumpkin purée and a healthy dose of chocolate chips or chunks. I love chocolate with pumpkin so much I have a few recipes on the blog to prove it like my [pumpkin chocolate chip pancakes](https://www.oliveandmango.com/pumpkin-chocolate-chip-pancakes/) and my [Pumpkin chocolate Espresso Bundt Cake](https://www.oliveandmango.com/pumpkin-espresso-bundt-cake-with-a-chocolate-espresso-rum-glaze/). This skillet cookie is soft on the inside with crispy edges. It’s great warm out of the oven with a scoop of vanilla icecream over it. You decide whether you plate it or enjoy it straight out of the skillet.

I made this recipe a while back and loved it and I actually photographed it last year and totally forgot it existed.  I think I may have shot it in January using the  last of my canned pumpkin purée that I usually have stocked for the fall season and pumpkin frenzy in the blogosphere.  It’s a recipe I made several times from Popsugar.  I don’t know how I came across it originally - I think I was sent the recipe by a friend who had made it and loved it. It’s actually a riff on Taylor Swift’s favorite pumpkin chocolate chip cookies. Although I’m not a big fan of hers (I know I just made many enemies) I do love this rif on her fav pumpkin cookies.

It’s not like your typical dense skillet cookies - it’s kind of like those fluffy cakie cookies out there that I love to have with a nice cup of tea or coffee.  I love the crunchy edges on it and that bit of fluffy chewiness to it. If you want it a little more gooey or dense and fudgey I would add extra chocolate chips for extra chocolatey puddles running through the batter and only bake it until it’s just set - test it with a tooth pick or sharp knife to get it to how you like it. Be mindful that the skillet really holds on to heat longer than a cake pan so the cookie will continue to ‘cook’ even when it’s out of the oven. I actually like refrigerating the leftovers as the middle gets a little fudgier like a brownie when it’s chilled. I’m been totally guilty of having as slice of it for breakfast - that says a lot cause other than smoothies I don’t eat much for breakfast.

The recipe calls for making it in a 12 inch skillet. I usually use my largest skillet or sometimes as photographed I will use my 9 inch skillet and spread the rest of the batter between 2 to 3 other mini skillets. The mini skillets are fun because they make great personal size desserts. If you aren’t a pumpkin spice lover this recipe might win you over. The pumpkin and spices aren’t too overpowering or nearly as intense as in a pumpkin pie - just enough to add some warming flavours to this skillet cookie. There are plenty of chocolate chips or chunks in every bite and I can never resist a slice of this while it’s still warm with a scoop of ice cream.  I hope you give it a try and see what all the fuss is about.
