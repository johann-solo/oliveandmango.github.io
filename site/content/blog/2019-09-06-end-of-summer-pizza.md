This end of summer pizza is not only easy to make but it’s so tasty it will be gone as soon as it’s sliced. Store bought pizza dough makes it especially simple and quick to whip up for a light dinner (no side salad required as it’s already on the pizza) or as an appetizer or snack. Some of my favorite grocery stores carry delicious fresh pizza dough that you can pick up on your way home from work and dinner is done in under 1 hour with very little prep time. Most of the time is oven time for the pizza. If you wanted to make your own [pizza dough this is my go to recipe](https://www.google.ca/amp/s/www.thekitchn.com/how-to-make-pizza-dough-recipe-221367%3famp=1) that I usually double to make a sheet pan pizza. 
If you are making it you will just have to plan ahead because the dough needs a little time to rise and rest. Sometimes I will make it a day or two before and have it ready to go in the fridge.

The ricotta is a fabulous choice for this pizza because it’s smooth and creamy and fluffy and baked up deliciously. I have also made it with my [whipped feta recipe](https://www.oliveandmango.com/zucchini-tart-with-whipped-feta-and-chives/). I usually double the amount for this sheet pan pizza. Just giving you options.

Ok let me tell why I really loved the idea of this pizza when I first saw the recipe on Epicurius.com. I love pizza with dressed arugula on my pizza so I thought I would definitely love this version too. I absolutely did and it reminded me of something. You know the delicious juice at the bottom of the salad bowl that you love to dip your crusty bread into (or am I the only one who does that?!?) - well that is what this pizza tastes like except even better. That’s because each bite has a bit of creamy ricotta in it along with some salty prosciutto. It’s phenomenal you guys and I know you will love it. Make sure and give it a try.
