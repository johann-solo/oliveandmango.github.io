A moist and delicious strawberry rhubarb cake with an olive oil streusel topping. There are plenty of our favourite summer fruits in season, meaning there’s never been a better time to enjoy them and bake with them.  Whether you have a bunch of berries that  were on sale or peaches from your market haul, there’s no better way to enjoy them than in a cobbler, crisp or buckle.

Cobblers and crisps are the most common ways to have baked fruit and the easiest especially when compared to pies. Buckles are just as easy to make but a bit different than a crisp or cobbler. Buckles are moist fruit cakes with streusel topping and they are called buckles because of the way their toppings/streusel buckle when baked. We love them and I finally got around to making one that I had save a while ago from _Food52_. I spotted it and it caught my eye because it’s made with a blend of AP flour and dark rye flour.   I don’t have much experience baking with rye but I do know I love it when I have had it in baked goods that others have made.

I turned to <span class="highlight"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.bobsredmill.com/organic-dark-rye-flour.html">Bob’s Red Mill</a></span></span> to get my dark rye flour - as you know Bob’s Red Mill uses high quality whole grains. They work hard to ensure the highest quality by maintaining a close relationship with their products every step of the way-- starting with the farmers who produce the grain and ending with shipping the finished product to your door! Why did I chose dark rye? Well it’s such an aromatic whole grain - and for a lot more than just bread. It’s malty, nuttty and slightly milky tasting and so good in baked goods. It’s always good to pair it with other milder wheat flours that can accommodate the individual or peculiar features or rye. It lends itself well with cherries and other stone fruit, rhubarb and most definitely chocolate.

The original recipe called for plums but I decided to do strawberries and rhubarb and it was just the best. I was so happy the recipe also called for olive oil too as I love baking with olive oil. I replaced the sour cream with ricotta and adjusted a couple of other things in the recipe as well.  The cake is tender with a fine crumb and the streusel is so delicious and a must. It gives the whole cake a lot of texture and flavour. You can use any fruit in this recipe just keep it to the alotted measurement of fruit in the recipe by weight. This will be perfect with peaches when there are in season here, but for now I’m happy with using all the berries and rhubarb any chance I get!!

### Ingredients

__For cake__

* <span itemprop="ingredients"> 1&frac13; cups all-purpose flour (160 grams)</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients"> &frac12; cup <span class="highlight"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.bobsredmill.com/organic-dark-rye-flour.html">Bob’s Red Mill dark rye flour</a></span></span> (60 grams)
* <span itemprop="ingredients"> &frac34; cup light brown sugar (148 grams)</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients"> 2 teaspoons baking powder</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients"> &frac14; tsp baking soda</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients"> &frac34; teaspoon kosher salt</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients"> &frac12; cup extra-virgin olive oil</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients"> 2 large eggs</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients"> &frac12; tsp vanilla extract </span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients"> &frac34; cup ricotta (180 grams)</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients"> 2 teaspoons finely grated lemon zest + 2 tablespoons juice from 1 large lemon</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients"> 1 pound of strawberries (hulled) and rhubarb sliced into &frac12;-inch wedges </span>

__For crumble topping__

* 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour (23 grams)
* 3 tablespoons dark rye flour (23 grams)
* 3 tablespoons light brown sugar (37 grams)
* &frac12; teaspoon cinnamon
* 1 pinch kosher salt
* 3 tablespoons sliced almonds (21 grams)
* 2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil

### Directions

1. Pre-heat oven to 350° F. Grease a 10-inch enameled or well-seasoned cast-iron skillet with olive oil (If your skillet isn’t well-seasoned, line the bottom with a round of parchment paper.)
2. In the meantime make crumble topping: in a small bowl, whisk together flours, brown sugar, cinnamon, salt, and almonds. Drizzle olive oil, a little at a time, stirring to thoroughly and evenly moisten the crumbs. Aim for a mix of larger and smaller clumps. Put the bowl in the freezer while preparing the rest of the cake.
3. In a large bowl, whisk the dry ingredients: all-purpose flour, rye flour, light brown sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt.
4. In a separate bowl, whisk together the wet ingredients: olive oil, eggs, sour cream, vanilla, lemon zest, and lemon juice.
5. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and fold with a spatula until just combined.
6. Scrape the batter into the prepared skillet. Arrange strawberry and rhubarb slices snugly and evenly over the batter. Gently press them down into the batter; you should see their tops. Remove the crumble topping from the freezer, and scatter it evenly over the batter. 
7. Bake until golden brown and firm to the touch, about 45-50 minutes or until a paring knife inserted into the middle comes out clean. Start checking at about 35 minutes for doneness.
8. Let cool in the skillet for about 30 minutes, and serve warm or at room temperature, straight from the pan
