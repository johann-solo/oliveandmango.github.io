Having a pumpkin scone recipe that is simple and delicious should be in everyone’s scone repertoire. This recipe is pretty classic and basic but it never disappoints. These scones turn out the same every time. Buttery, light and soft on the inside with nice crispy edges on the outside. My husband loves these more than their Starbucks counterpart. He finds the flavours are the same but the ones at Starbucks are crunchier. That being said we all have very different tastes when it comes to how we like our scones. My preference is the above mentioned - light, soft with crispy edges. If that is yours as well you will love them, and if it’s not you should still try them cause you may just change your mind about how you like your scones- at least your pumpkin ones.

The pumpkin gives them colour and moisture and the spices help that pumpkin spice flavour that we all love (most of us at least) come alive. You can keep them simple and with a sprinkling of coarse raw sugar or you can go all the way with the two glazes. I personally thought I would have preferred the sugar only approach, but to my surprise I love the glazes. It’s definitely not too much or too sweet and they both compliment the scones so well and I think they are also responsible for keeping the day olds quite moist, if there are any left the next day.

That was not the case at our place. They were gone quite quickly. They had barely cooled enough before we got our claws on them. I did sneak a few away to share with a sweet friend who thoroughly enjoyed them too.

They whip up in no time and can be made easily in the food processor or by hand. They are a hit with everyone who I have shared them with and go perfectly well with a pumpkin spiced latte - that might be pumpkin overkill but it is fall after all and we are starting to get into the cozy drink and food season so we might as well milk it! Enjoy these you guys - we adored them and think you will too!

## Recipe

### Ingredients

__For the Scones__

* ½ cup granulated sugar
* 2 tsps baking powder
* 1 tsp ground ginger
½ tsp freshly grated nutmeg
* ½ tsp ground cinnamon
* ½ tsp kosher salt
* ¼ tsp ground cloves
* &frac14; tsp ground cardamom 
* ¼ tsp baking soda
* 2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for surface
* ¾ cup (1½ sticks) chilled unsalted butter (sliced into cubes if using food processor or grated with box grater if making by hand)
* 1 large egg
* ½ cup canned pure pumpkin purée
* ¼ cup buttermilk, plus more for brushing
* &frac12; tsp vanilla extract
* 2 tbsp raw sugar (optional if not glazing)
Optional extras - &frac12; cup of fresh cranberries or frozen, thawed and chopped or &frac12; cup of chocolate chips

### Directions

1. Whisk granulated sugar, baking powder, ginger, nutmeg, cinnamon, salt, cloves, cardamom, baking soda, and 2 cups flour in a large bowl. 
2. Using the large holes on a box grater, grate in butter, tossing to coat in dry ingredients as you go (alternatively pulse the dry ingredients a few time in a food processor and then pulse the stick of butter that has been sliced into the flour Approx 20 times until coarse crumble forms)
3. In a separate bowl wish together the in egg, pumpkin, vanilla, and ¼ cup buttermilk.
4. Stir the pumpkin mixture into the flour and butter mixture until a soft dough forms. (If using the food processor pulse a few times until dough forms - being careful to not over work)
5. Transfer dough to a lightly floured surface and knead three to four times until it comes together.
6. Pat into a 1½”-thick disk. 
7. Cut into 8 wedges; transfer to a parchment-lined baking sheet. 
8. Freeze until firm, approx 20 minutes.
9. Preheat oven to 400°F. 
10. Brush scones with buttermilk and sprinkle with raw sugar if not glazing. 
11. Bake until golden brown, 20–25 minutes.

### Ingredients

__For the glaze__

SIMPLE SUGAR GLAZE

* 1 cup powdered sugar
* 1 to 2 tbsp half and half or cream

PUMPKIN SPICE GLAZE

* 1 cup powdered sugar
* 1 tbsp pumpkin puree
* &frac18; tsp cloves
* &frac18; tsp ground nutmeg
* &frac18; tsp ground ginger
* &frac14; tsp ground cinnamon
* 1 to 2 tbsp half and half or cream

### Directions

1. For the simple sugar glaze, add the sugar to a medium bowl then add one tablespoon of half and half. 
1. Stir then judge the consistency. You want a slow drizzle when picked up with a spoon. If it is too thick, add a little more half and half (a little goes a long way, here). If it is too thin, add a little more powdered sugar.
1. In another bowl, make the pumpkin spice glaze. 
1. Combine the sugar, pumpkin puree, spices then add one tablespoon of half and half. 
1. Stir and check consistency. 
1. Adjust the same way as you would the simple glaze.

__To finish with glaze__

1. Dip each cooled scone directly into the simple sugar glaze then place glazed side up back onto the cooling rack.
1. Use a spoon to drizzle a zigzag pattern of the pumpkin spice glaze across each scone. 
1. Wait 15 minutes or until the glaze has set then enjoy!
1. Store baked and glazed scones covered with plastic wrap. We recommend storing in the refrigerator if storing them for more than a day. They will lose a little moisture, but will still taste great.
