### Ingredients

* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 pounds carrots scrubbed clean or peeled and cut into 2 inch pieces </span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">&frac12; cup butter (1 stick of butter) </span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 Tablespoons maple syrup </span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 garlic cloves peeled and chopped</span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">salt and pepper</span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tsp fresh thyme plus more for garnish </span>
</br>

### Directions

1.	Preheat oven to 425°F. In a medium saucepan add the butter and cook over medium-high heat whisking until the butter starts to become frothy and nutty smelling and golden brown. This will take approx 3-5 minutes. Then add the maple syrup, thyme and garlic and remove from heat.
2.	Place carrots in a large bowl and carefully drizzle the brown butter maple sauce on top. Toss until coated and spread evenly on a large baking sheet. Season with salt and pepper.
3.	Cover with foil and roast for 10 minutes then remove foil and continue roasting another 10-15 minutes or until carrots are tender. Transfer to a serving dish or platter and garnish with some fresh thyme. Serve immediately.

### Recipe Note
If you want your carrots to have more golden crisp edges - continue to roast until they are cooked to your liking. Or you can broil them for a couple of minutes while keeping a close eye on them so that they don’t burn.
