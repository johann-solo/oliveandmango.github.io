I never tire of a chocolate treat. I hope you don’t either. This is one I crave every once in a while when I need and instant chocolate (you know what I mean ladies). You can’t beat a cake that is personal sized and done in 70 seconds. If you are opposed to using a microwave or want to make a batch in the oven, there are directions below on how to do that. If you do end up using an oven to make this I would recommend prepping a batch because preheating an oven for one mug cake just doesn’t make any sense.

I partnered up with _GoGo Quinoa_ to share this recipe using their Organic Buckwheat Flakes.  I always love sharing unique ways to use ingredients. These buckwheat flakes can be used in any way that you would use oat flakes.  I love making oat flour with oat flakes and thought I would do the same with these buckwheat flakes. Buckwheat flour is hearty, gluten-free, and a good source of magnesium, copper, and dietary fiber. We enjoy its health benefits, but we also love it for its bold, nutty flavor. I wanted to use it to make a sweet GF (yes Buckwheat is a seed and therefore naturally GF) treat that will quickly satisfy my sweet tooth when it’s begging for something chocolatey.

These little mug cakes take only minutes to prep and just over a minute to cook in the microwave. They come out fluffy and delicious with a bold, toasty, and rich flavour.  They are best eaten warm right out of the microwave topped with either a dollop of coconut cream or melty icecream and a dusting of cocoa powder. The best part of eating them warm is the gooey centre created by the dollop of your choice of filling. I used Nutella cause that is always my first choice but feel free to use peanut butter or any other nut or seed butter and even a fruit preserve or purée of choice.

I have always wanted to recreate a mug cake. I have had the packaged version of these and knew that a homemade one would taste way better but just never had the opportunity to make one. So here it is and I think you are going to love it. If you wanted to make more than one of them it’s quite easy to do. Either double or triple the recipe according to how many you want to make, prepping it in a large bowl or mix the portions in the mugs themselves and microwave them one at a time to make sure they cook evenly. 70 seconds each makes for a quick turn over and no one will complain about the wait I promise. Enjoy!

## Recipe
This recipe makes 1 mug cake 
</br>
</br>

### Ingredients

* <span itemprop="ingredients"> ¼ cup buckwheat flour (homemade from Flakes below) </span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients"> 1 tablespoons cocoa powder plus more for dusting </span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients"> ¼ teaspoon baking powder</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients"> 1 ½ tablespoons sugar</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients"> &frac14; tsp of espresso powder or instant coffee </span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients"> Pinch of salt</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients"> 5 tablespoons of almond milk (or your choice of non dairy milk) </span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients"> 2 tablespoons coconut oil or your choice of vegetable oil </span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients"> &frac14; tsp vanilla extract </span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients"> 1 heaping tbsp of filling of your choice - I used chocolate hazelnut spread but peanut butter or almond butter would work and so will a fruit purée</span>

### Cream topping

* 1 can coconut cream, set overnight in the fridge
* 3 Tbsp. powdered sugar (optional) 
* 1 tsp. vanilla extract

### Directions

1. Mix together the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, sugar, and salt, using a whisk.
2. Add the milk and vegetable oil and whisk until well combined.
3. Scrape into a microwave-safe mug, small bowl or ramekin And then spoon your choice of filling into the middle of the cup
4. Place the cup in the microwave and then cook the cake for around 70 seconds on high.  
5. To make the coconut  whip topping: With an electric mixer, whip up the solid coconut cream from the can (if you are using cream, the majority of the can should actually solidify) and powdered sugar until fluffy. Add the vanilla and fluff up for another 30 seconds. (Any extra will keep for a few days in a sealed container for a few days - you may just need to whip again before using) 
6. Add a dollop of coconut cream on top and serve right in the mug/ramekin while it’s nice and warm (icecream is also great on top) 

### Recipe Notes
You can mix this whole thing in your mug or ramekin if you want to avoid washing up an extra bowl, but it will be easier to get rid of lumps in a bowl. Soft the cocoa if you find that it’s lumpy

## Homemade Buckwheat Flour
Yields approx 1 cup plus 2 tbsps of buckwheat flour
</br>
</br>

### Ingredient

* 1 cup GoGo quinoa buckwheat flakes 

### Directions

* Place the flakes in a high powdered blender or food processor and blend for approx 1 minute until you have a powdery consistency. Use as you wish. 

### Recipe Notes
Can you make these in the oven? Sure you can! Make sure you are using an oven safe mug though and increase baking time to approx 20- 25 minutes at 350 &deg; F. If using an oven to make this I would recommend prepping a batch because preheating an oven for one mug cake just doesn’t make any sense.
