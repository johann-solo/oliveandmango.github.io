excerpt: A lighter low carb option

This chipotle style chicken filling is so wonderful and can fill more than lettuce. You can use it in hard or soft tacos, and I absolutely love using it in a taco bowl over [cilantro rice](https://www.oliveandmango.com/vegan-and-vegetarian-fiesta-bowl/) with all the add ins. It's so versatile and has just the right amount of heat, at least to my liking. You can definitely add more chipotle or adobo sauce if you want more heat

Best of all it’s so easy to whip up and great for company as most taco recipes are. What better than a taco station for feeding a crowd? Lay everything out on the table and let everyone put there tacos together. It’s a fun, casual and delicious way of eating.

The lettuce lightens up the meal a bit and adds some fresh crunch to your tacos. It keeps things low carb if you are looking for low carb meal options and increases your veggie intake. There’s definitely nothing wrong with that! I like to do both especially for company. Giving a GF option is great for company because there’s always someone in the crowd that is either intolerant or sensitive to it.

These are also wonderful without the meat. The beans, corn and veggies make quite a filling on their own without the meat so these are also easily and deliciously made vegan. You would just have to hold off on the yoghurt in the avocado cream.

### Ingredients

* 2 tbsp of olive oil
* 1 large red onion sliced
* 1 green pepper cored and sliced
* 1 clove of garlic minced
* 1 cup corn (frozen or fresh)
* 15oz can of black beans
* 1 chipotle pepper + 1&frac12; tablespoons adobo sauce (more sauce and extra pepper can be added if you want more heat)
* 3 tbsp of taco seasoning (store bought or homemade recipe below)
* &frac14; cup of water
* 1 lb of ground chicken or turkey (ground beef can also be used as well)
* Salt and pepper to taste
* 2 small heads of bibb or butter lettuce or any leafy lettuce that will hold up cleaned and dried
* Avocado cream to serve (recipe below
* Toppings of choice for serving

__For avocado cream__

* 1 ripe avocado
* &frac14; cup plain Greek yogurt or sour cream
* Juice of &frac12;-1 lime according to taste
* Pinch of garlic powder (optional)
* Salt and pepper to taste


### Directions

1. Heat 1 tbsp of oil in a skillet over medium heat. 
1. Add the ground chicken/meat and sauté until cooked through and no longer pink. 
1. Break up the chicken into small crumbles as you cook it.
1. While that is cooking heat remaining oil in another skillet at medium heat and toss in the green pepper and red onions and sauté until edges are golden and veggies are softened then add the garlic and sauté for a minute and remove from heat.
1. Once chicken is cooked add the veggies to the chicken along with the corn and beans stirring and cooking together until everything is warmed though.
1. Sprinkle the taco seasoning over the meat and veggies and 1/4 cup of water and stir everything well and continue cooking for a few minutes until liquid has reduced and thickened slightly. 
1. Season well with salt and pepper to taste and take off heat while preparing the avocado cream and chop up the rest of your toppings.
1. To make the avocado cream mash the avocado in a bowl with a fork and stir in yogurt, lime juice, garlic powder, and salt. You could do this by hand or you could also do this in the food processor for a very creamy texture.

__To assemble__

1. Break off all the lettuce leaves and pile them on a plate or platter along with all the other chosen toppings and the avocado cream.
1. Transfer the hot chicken mixture to a serving dish, or serve straight from the skillet.
1. Spread avocado cream onto each lettuce leaf and then spoon over a generous spoonful of chicken mixture in the middle of a lettuce leaf, top with whatever toppings you would like and serve and enjoy.

__Topping options__
chopped green onion or chives, chopped tomato, shredded cheese, fresh or pickled jalapeño slices, chopped radishes for extra crunch, chopped fresh cilantro, nachos and the list can go on. Have fun and try as many as you would like. My all time favorite is also [homemade poco de gallo](https://www.oliveandmango.com/keep-ya-coming-back-chunky-tomato-salsa/)
