excerpt: The perfect homemade snack or addition to any dip or cheese board

These crackers or crisps plus a sharp creamy cheese or Boursin are literally my kryptonite! I can’t fully express the joy I had seeing Nagi post a video of making these on Recipe Tin on IG.  I saved the recipe immediately and made plans to make this simple recipe.  Why was I so hype about making these? You probably guessed it. I haven’t seen these around in Trinidad ever – well maybe once and I remember buying a pack and spending way too much on it but enjoying every bite of them. Then I didn’t see them again. Back home they were available everywhere and made by many brands all equally delicious. Probably still over priced but a least they were around if you were craving some or wanted to get some for your cheeseboard.

Anyways now you understand why I was so elated and excited to try this recipe. They turned out fabulously. I used a basic loaf pan to bake them in but a smaller less wide one would make the cracker/loaf rise higher making a taller cracker than a wider one. Nagi said in her post that the recipe she adapted them from called for baking them in mason jars so that they are more circular in shape then rectangular.  Like her I don’t understand how that works and not too sure if my mason jars are heat proof so I didn’t risk it but if you know how I would love to know. I’m pretty happy with this method though and will stick to it.  To tell you the truth it really doesn’t matter what shape they are. As long as you can cut them thin they will be delicious and crisp and addictive.

I also love that you can really be creative when making these.  You can add more or less seeds and even add flax seeds as well. You can also use all whole wheat flour or all AP flour if you don’t have one or the other. These would be great with raisins and dates too if you aren’t a fan of cranberries or can’t find any.  Its great when you can make a recipe your own and this one definitely allows for that.

Not only are they a more cost effective way of enjoying these crackers but they are even more fresh and flavourful made at home by you! These will be on repeat!! I already made one other batch. We absolutely love them and know you will too! They are always part of my charcuterie board or cheese platters and make the perfect edible "plate".

### Directions

1. Preheat oven to 350&deg;F Grease and line a loaf pan with baking paper – the smaller the better for more height in the loaf/crackers  
2. In a small bowl whisk together the milk, sugar and yoghurt.
3. In a separate bowl, whisk the flours together and add the cranberries. Stir – use fingers to break up cranberries if needed.
4. Add remaining ingredients, including Spices, plus the milk mixture. It will be a thick batter.  
5. Pour into loaf pan and bake for approx 25-35 minutes or until a skewer inserted into the middle comes out clean. 
6. Cool on rack for 10 minutes, remove from pan and place on rack to cool completely then wrap in cling wrap and freeze for at least 2 hours, up to 3 months.*
7. Unwrap loaf when ready to use and allow to thaw partially for a few minutes so it’s easier to cut.  
8. Preheat oven 250&deg;F.
9. Use a sharp serrated bread knife to slice loaf thinly.
10. Place biscuits on 2 large baking trays
11. Bake for 50 minutes or until they are a light brown, rotating trays halfway.
12. Leave biscuits on tray to cool – they will harden so they snap when you break them.
13. Store in an airtight container for 4 weeks.

### Recipe Notes
\* If your crackers get soft or loose a bit of their crispness after being stored for awhile
just pop them back in a 350˚F oven for about 5 minutes. They’ll be fresh as ever.
