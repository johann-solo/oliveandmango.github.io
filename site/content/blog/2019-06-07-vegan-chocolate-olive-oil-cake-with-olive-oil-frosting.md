I love to bake with good extra virgin olive oil because it adds a wonderful, rich flavour to cakes, tortes, brownies, and bread. Baking with olive oil also gives baked goods a light texture. Baking with it – instead of butter, is a good way to cut saturated fat. Plus, olive oil is loaded with monounsaturated fat, which promotes good cholesterol. Good olive oil is and has always been a part of my life in the kitchen. My mom has had olive oil imported from Greece for as long as I can remember and I have always gotten my stash from her. I have never taken a drop of it for granted. It’s like liquid gold in my house.

 This is common in most European (especially Greek, Italian and Portuguese) households. Today,  it’s said that Spain is the largest producer of olive oil by volume, followed by Italy and Greece. However, per capita national consumption is highest in Greece – we Greeks truly treasure our olive oil and not only use it to cook with and bake with but we use it to dress and finish off our meals and salads too. We enjoy it’s rich flavour and aroma so very much.  This is why I was so over the moon to be partnering up with <span class="highlight"><a rel="nofollow" href="http://kalikori.com/">Kalikori</a></span> to create a simple yet delicious recipe using their Premium cold pressed L’olivier de Vassily Olive Oil.

When you first crack open the bottle and take a sniff you can tell this is not your ordinary olive oil. In Greek we say _μοσχοβολάει_ which is one word to describe something beautifully fragrant. This olive oil comes directly from an olive grove of vatsikes olive trees in the hills near Kaethéa, in the Kalamata region of Greece. It’s a grove on family land owned, nurtured and harvested by the Ligris family since the first grove was planted in 1950. It was planted by Vassily Ligris and his son and now it’s in the hands of his granddaughter Effy Ligris. Effy, with the approval and blessing of her family, has established her company Kalikori so that she can share this bounty with others across the Atlantic. It is so appropriate that the name of the company is  Kalikori meaning “good daughter” in Greek and pays homage to Effy’s forebears and her heritage. Kalikori’s premium cold-pressed L’Olivier de Vassily olive oil, is named after and in honor of her Grandfather “Papou Vassily”.

The small green vatsikes variety of olives are exclusively grown for oil. And as a result of an early harvest and the rocky mountainous kalamata region, the amount of oil produced from the Ligris grove is small but of Premium quality, L'Olivier de Vassily is not a blend. It comes only from the olives of the Vatsikes trees planted by Effy’s “Papou” and Father, The early picking gives the oil its green colour, its aroma its peppery finish and the flavor of spring grass under the Mediterranean sun. Like fine wine, the unique flavor of each year’s yield depends on the climate and the rainfall. As the quantity is limited, the number of bottles varies from year to year making it a very precious commodity.

I decided on this olive oil cake because it’s one of my favourite simple-to-y make chocolate cakes. It’s made with very basic pantry ingredients. The texture of it is wonderful when baking it with olive oil and the flavour is rich a decadent. I wanted to showcase this wonderful olive oil in something baked but also as a ‘finishing oil’ so to speak or in its raw form, creating a simple frosting for the cake as well. The frosting is rich, velvety and fudgey. The cocoa stands up well with the very bold and distinct  flavour of this olive oil. You will love this cake. It bakes up in no time. You can double the recipe to make this beautiful layered cake which is a bit of a showstopper for special occasions or you can keep it single layered for a simple family dinner or bbq. It doesn’t take much to dress it. Pile on fresh berries and you can even dust a little powdered sugar or cocoa for a little something extra. With very little effort, this bowl and whisk cake sure impresses and will have you going back for an extra slice.
