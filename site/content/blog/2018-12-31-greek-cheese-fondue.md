This is one fabulous and beloved cheese dip or fondue. One of the reasons I love it besides the fact that it’s super delicious, is it’s made with some very common cheeses that you can pretty much find at any grocery store. Some fondues call for more obscure cheeses that can be a little pricey or you end up having to sub out for more common ones cause you can’t locate them. This one is far less fussy than your classic fondue too making it simple and quick to whip up.

It’s one of my favorite warm cheese dips and it’s a recipe I have been using from the _Delish_ website since I first saw it. I haven’t changed or tweaked anything from the recipe at all other than the toppings. It’s perfect just the way it is and we absolutely love it and I had to share it on the blog cause it’s so beloved and on repeat when we have friends over. I made it for my family this passed weekend and was reminded of how good it is and how addictive it is.

I thought it would be the perfect recipe to share on the last day of 2018 as we just made it and I finally got a chance to shoot it but I also know a lot of you are loving the appetizers right now so I thought I would throw one last one into the mix. It’s also one that you might just have all the ingredients for already in your fridge.

I’m definitely partial to this dip. As many of you know I’m Greek by descent and am partial to feta - that being said I don’t think you have to be Greek to be partial to feta cause who doesn’t love feta!?!? But I’m sure it somehow runs through my veins - in good company with olive oil and oregano. So if you are like me and love feta or cheese in general, you are going to love this warm cheese dip. It’s got tang and saltiness from the different cheeses and the yogurt and lemon juice in it. That really gives it a pleasant lighter taste which is sort of dangerous cause you could easily eat a whole lot of it because of that.

I love to top mine with whatever you would have on a [Greek village salad (horiatiki)](https://www.oliveandmango.com/classic-greek-village-salad-horiatiki/). I also love to serve mine with pita chips or baguette crisps. They are the crunchiest and go so well with the dip. It would be great with warm soft pita bread too though but to keep things simple, the crisps work wonderfully.

This year had been a bit of a whirlwind of change with some highs and lows that I won’t bore you with. I look forward to a more stable 2019 where I feel a bit more settled and feel like I can run the blog with some rhythm/routine. I’m very appreciative of all of you who check back and love the recipes and share your thoughts and ideas on here and Instagram and I will keep pushing forward with some more inspiring ideas for home cooking. I’m looking forward to it and some new adventures come January! Thanks for your support always. I will be sharing a 2018 favorite recipe round up in the new year.
