This easy Greek Fava (φάβα) recipe is a dip similar to hummus. It’s so creamy, flavourful, simple to make, vegan and one of my favourite things to order as an appetizer when I’m in Greece. No need to travel to enjoy this tasty Greek spread or dip though. This Greek Fava recipe only requires a handful of ingredients and takes no time to make. Serve with plenty of crackers, bread or pita and fresh veggies, add it to your charcuterie boards or serve as an appetizer. I partnered up with Bob’s Red Mill to showcase this delicious vegan charcuterie or cheese platter showcasing their new <span class="highlight"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.bobsredmill.com/rosemary-oat-crackers.html/?utm_source=TheOliveAndMango&utm_medium=influencer&utm_campaign=bobsredmill">Oat Crackers</a></span> and featuring one of my all time favorite spreads - this smooth and delicious Greek Fava dip.

## What is Greek fava? 
We call this delcious smooth and creamy dip fava but it’s not made of fava beans or broad beans. Greek fava refers to yellow split peas that are puréed and served as a dip or at times as a soup. I read that originally the recipe referred to and used broad beans but eventually the broad beans (which in Greek are called koukia) were replaced with an easier version, the yellow shelled split pea. This dish hails from Santorini where Greek fava is cutivated. There are other places that cultivate it but because of the volcanic and nutrient rich soil, Santorini is known to produce one of the best and most flavourful varieties of it. In fact this dip is often referred to as Santorini Fava. I brought home several bags of split peas while I traveled there a few years ago and I’m so glad I made space in my luggage for it. You can order Santorini yellow split peas online at Greek specialty shops or even Amazon, but you can also just use regular yellow split peas to make a delicious version of this classic at home.

## Greek fava dip Ingredients: 
It’s just a handful of simple ingredients but together they make a tasty spread: 
* Santorini fava: or yellow split peas are the staple in this recipe. 
* Olive oil: A must in Greek cooking. I use it to sauté the shallot and garlic but I also drizzle a good bit of it over top dip before serving 
* Shallot: I love the sweetness of shallots but red onions work well here too 
* Garlic: a definite must. Feel free to use less or more according to taste 
* Lemon juice: I like to finish using loads of it but you can use as much or as little as you like to taste 
* Seasoning: bay leaf is all I add and a pinch of cumin and salt while the peas are simmering for flavour but you could add oregano, paprika and even chili flakes too 
* Toppings: the most customary ones are chopped shallots or red onions and capers, but chopped olives, sundried tomatoes and dusting with cumin, paprika or oregano are fine too or you could do a combo of a few of those things

## How to make Greek fava? 
There are a few ways to make this famous Greek dip but this is the way I think yields the most flavourful fava: 
1. Sauté the shallot and garlic 
1. Add water/stock and peas and simmer until tender 
1. Blend the peas once softened using an immersion blender, tabletop blender or a food processor until smooth. Add lemon juice to taste and seaon with slat and pepper
1. Allow to cool - will thicken as it cools.  
1. Plate and Serve topped with a generous drizzle of olive oil and a sprinkle of paprika or cumin and garnished with chopped shallots or red onions and capers

## How to serve Greek fava? 
I like to make this as an appetizer, or like this on a cheese platter or mezze platter. This is my favorite vegan cheese platter and it’s so simple to make. More info  below on how to make one. Set out a few dishes, along with plenty of things to dip into it like crisps and veggies, open some wine, and have a little party. This Greek Fave recipe can also easily be made and served as a soup too. I usually add more stock or water to the split peas and blend it until I reach the consistency I like, adding more stock as needed. Serve it hot with a drizzle of olive oil and loads of lemon juice too.

## How to make a vegan cheese platter? 
Cheese platters are the most fun to make! At least I think so! There are so many things you could add to one but I’m breaking it down into categories and the final choices are up to you. •Start by choosing a board, Wooden, ceramic, marble or even a Sheetpan 
1. Choose a variety of cheeses - I like a variety  of textures so I will usually get a brie-like spreadable one, a hard sliceable one and a crumbly one - Κite Hill, Myokos, Daiya and Nuts for Cheese are my favs to choose from that are available where I am. 
1. Choose some savory items like pickles, veggies, olives and sundried tomatoes, salted or plain nuts etc..
1. Choose some sweet items as well - fresh fruit, dried fruit, jams or spreads and even some chocolate 
1. Choose spreads like hummus or this Greek creamy fava dip 
1. Choose your crisps or cracker - I love these ones from <span class="highlight"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.bobsredmill.com/rosemary-oat-crackers.html/?utm_source=TheOliveAndMango&utm_medium=influencer&utm_campaign=bobsredmill">Bob’s Red Mill</a></span> because the are gf, crisp and come in 4 different flavours. They are so crispy, made with whole grain flours (oat flour, brown rice and quinoa), oats, almond flour and flaxseeds. They are the perfect plant based gluten free crackers - with excellent texture and no waxy feel. They are a great addition to any charcuterie or cheese platter perfect for hosting friends and family. 
1. Decorate with fresh herbs - This is a fun way to fill in any gaps and further beautify your board
