Coq au vin is a great French classic dish that I’m quite fond of. It is a very homey traditional slow braised rooster or chicken, usually made with red wine. It’s one of those dishes that is made up of layers of flavours and when prepared  authentically reminds me of beef bourguignon, in that almost each element of the dish gets its own pan time. This has a lot to do with building those fabulous layers of flavour in both of those dishes, but it can also be time consuming to make. Another thing that can be intimidating to some when cooking coq au vin is that after all that time and effort, in the end, there is a chance you will be left with purple chicken from it simmering in red wine.

I partnered up with _Black Celler Wine_, a Canadian wine company, to make something fabulous using their Pinot Grigio. I couldn’t wait to use it in my quick one pan coq au vin blanc recipe that I love making! It was perfect in it. The best part is that this version is a one pan version as the name implies, so no need to sauté each ingredient individually which saves a lot of time, and another bonus is that it always turns out the same colour as it’s made with white wine (also implied by the name).

The Pinot Grigio is smooth and refreshingly crisp - perfect in this rich and creamy dish. It adds a nice lightness to it and cuts through the richness of it. It also is the perfect pairing for the dish too. What you use in cooking should be good enough to drink and enjoy too, and this is definitely one of those wines that’s good for both.

It’s a great dish that can be made even in the mid week. Because it’s a one pan meal, it’s less fuss and a lot less time to make than the traditional version. It’s perfect over buttery egg noodles which take next to nothing to boil and have ready and the perfect meal for date night as well. It’s also great with mashed potatoes or even just some crusty bread on the side to dip into that wonderful sauce. It’s incredibly warming and comforting like a delicious hug in bowl and when the weather turns cool, it’s always a meal I crave.

I do love the original version braised low and slow in red wine, but to be honest, I love this one more. White wine is less overpowering, adds a much brighter flavour and doesn’t affect the color of the chicken plus it takes way less time to make. I think you will feel the same about this one and hope you give it a try.

</br> 

### Ingredients

* <span itemprop="ingredients"> 1 tbsp olive oil </span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients"> 4 slices bacon, cut into &frac12;-inch pieces</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients"> 6 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs (about 3 &frac12; pounds total)</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients"> Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients"> &frac14; cup all-purpose flour, for sprinkling (optional</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients"> 4 shallots peeled and quartered or one large onion </span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients"> 3 cloves of garlic</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients"> 8 ounces cremini mushrooms, halved (quartered, if large) </span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients"> 2 carrots peeled and finely sliced </span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients"> 2 celery stalks, finely chopped </span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients"> 1 &frac12; cups white wine (I used Black Cellar Wine Pinot Grigio) </span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients"> &frac12; tbsp of fresh thyme </span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients"> 2 tsp chopped fresh rosemary</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients"> &frac12; cup heavy cream</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients"> Fresh parsley for garnish </span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients"> Egg noodles to serve with or mashed potatoes or just some crusty bread to dip into the lovely sauce</span>

### Directions

1. Season chicken with salt and pepper and sprinkle with flour if using 
2. Heat a large frying pan with the olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the bacon and cook until almost crisp, 2 to 3 min. 
3. Add mushrooms, celery, carrots, garlic and onion/shallots and continue cooking, stirring often, until bacon is crisp and mushrooms are browned, 7 to 8 min.
4. Slide the vegetables and bacon to the side of pan, then add chicken, skin-side down, to other side of pan and cook until dark golden, about 4 min per side. May have to do this in batches if they all don’t fit in your pan. 
5. Keep and eye on the veggies and stir them about while browning the chicken so you don’t have any burnt pieces.  
6. Add wine, thyme, rosemary. 
7. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low. 
8. Simmer, covered, until chicken is cooked through and mixture has reduced and is saucy, 15 to 20 min.
9. Transfer chicken to a platter before adding the cream or add cream right into sauce and vegetables in with the chicken in the pan. (Either is fine - if you add it while the chicken is in the pan just make sure to pour it into the sauce not over the chicken so that the chicken stays brown in colour) 
10. Boil until mixture is slightly thickened, about 5 min. 
11. Pour sauce over chicken when serving and sprinkle with remaining 1 tsp thyme and parsley and serve over buttery egg noodles or mashed potatoes.
