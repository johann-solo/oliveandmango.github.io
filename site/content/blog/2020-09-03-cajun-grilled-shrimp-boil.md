This is my grilled twist on a classic shrimp boil. Grilled shrimp, smoked sausage, corn and potatoes all smothered in Cajun seasoned garlic butter. It's the ultimate summer main course. It’s super flavourful thanks to that tasty garlic butter. It’s fun to serve and to eat.

A more traditional shrimp boil is done in a large pot of seasoned water.  Ears of corn, potatoes, onions, and heads of garlic are usually in the mix along with smoked sausage - usually andouille. Some variations also include crawfish, mussels, clams, oysters, lobster or crab. The essential ingredient is crab boil seasoning, Old Bay seasoning or Zatarian are the most popular ones - which are a mix a mix of spices including mustard seeds, coriander, cayenne pepper, bay leaves, dill and allspice. Everything gets boiled and cook until it's done. Then everything gets dumped onto a newspaper covered table and served with hot sauce, lemon and melted butter.

I love it done traditionally but I have to say nothing beats it grilled in my opinion. In this version the potatoes and corn do get boiled for a few minutes then they get tossed in that fabulous Cajun seasoned garlic butter. The smoked sausages are grilled rather than boiled which I much prefer and the shrimp also get tossed with the garlic butter before hitting the grill.  I love the extra smoky flavour grilling gives everything. I used Irresistibles brand Cajun seasoning in place of the traditional and it was fabulous - just enough spice and smokiness added to the the garlic butter.  The flavours are not lost in the water so to speak but get doused with them before each item is grilled up and then served with extra for drizzling or dipping after.

This grilled shrimp boil recipe is a wonderful, and so easy to prepare and one your family will love. It’s an easy-to-share platter. Slices of  double smoked sausage with tender-crisp shrimp, sweet, juicy corn and creamy potatoes grilled to perfection and then finished off with extra garlic butter, lemon wedges and parsley.  If you don’t have a grill - you can also covert this into a very tasty sheet pan meal done in the oven. Drizzle everything with the garlic butter then roast for 10 minutes and then broil for a couple more and then done. Serve the same way as the grilled version. You will love this shrimp boil either way! Enjoy!

### Directions 

1. Melt butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Add the garlic and simmer 1 minute. Stir in cajun seasoning and hot sauce if using and season with salt to taste if needed. Squeeze juice of halved lemon into butter mixture. Remove from heat; cover to keep warm.

2. Cover potatoes with 2 inches cold water in a large pot and bring to a boil. Add 2 tablespoons salt, reduce heat to a simmer, and cook until potatoes are just tender when pierced with the tip of a sharp knife, about 10 mins. Add corn and squeeze in the other  lemon half adding the lemon in after squeezing, return to a boil, then drain. Place in large bowl and toss with 1 tbsp of butter sauce. Preheat grill or grill pan to medium-high. Brush grates with oil. Toss shrimp with 1 tablespoon of butter mixture in a bowl and set aside.  

3. Grill sausages 6-7 min each side or until done, grill potatoes and corn, turning occasionally, and once the sausages are nearly done grill shrimp until cooked through and potatoes and corn are marked in spots, about 3 minutes for shrimp, 4 to 5 minutes for vegetables. 

4. Slice the sausages into 1 inch pieces. Transfer everything to a large bowl or serving platter. Serve with remaining butter mixture on the side. Sprinkle with chopped parsley and serve with extra lemon wedges and hot sauce.
