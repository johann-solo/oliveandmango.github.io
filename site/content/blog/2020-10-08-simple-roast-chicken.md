This simple roast chicken with garlic herbed butter turns out perfect every time. Its tender and juicy on the inside with golden crisp skin. It  has the tastiest pan juices that can easily be turned into a luscious gravy. It’s hard to believe it’s taken me this long to share a basic and classic roast chicken recipe, but I suppose it’s better late than never.  There are so many variations of a classic roast chicken. This is one of my favorites because it’s infused with wonderful flavours and there are loads of delicious pan juices that are used to sauce to the chicken with or to make into a gravy if you are serving it with mashed potatoes or [cauliflower mash](https://www.oliveandmango.com/cider-braised-chicken-thighs-with-the-creamiest-cauliflower-mash/).

It makes for a great meal that requires minimal prep work with fantastic textures and flavors with the garlic, butter and herbs. I know a lot of roast chicken recipes call for roasting veggies with the chicken or under the chicken and Im not opposed to that but it’s not my favorite either. I don’t like how mushy the veggies get. I usually roast my veggies separately so they stay tender and cook more evenly. This delicious roast chicken recipe does have something roasting under it though. It’s roasted over a bed of garlic and onion. This keeps the chicken elevated and off the pan which allows it to cook evenly and as a bonus adds extra flavour to the pan juices.

### Tips to making the perfect roast chicken:

* Always pat the skin of the chicken dry with paper towels. The drier the skin the crispier it will be. Seasoning the chicken well with salt inside and out helps with this and adds loads of flavour to the chicken. 
* Use kitchen twine to tie the chicken legs together. This helps keep them close to the body and helps cook the chicken evenly as well. 
* Make sure to baste the chicken 2-3 times while it’s roasting. Basting helps keep the meat moist, and adds flavor.
* The herb and garlic butter over and under the skin helps flavour the chicken - feel free to switch up the combination of herbs and seasonings in the garlic butter. I chose thyme and rosemary because I tend to always have them around. You can even use dried herbs or seasoning blends too. If you like a particular salt rub feel free to use that instead of regular salt and pepper or even as a flavour ingredient for the butter. It really is up to your taste. •
* Always allow 10-15 min of resting uncovered before slicing into it so the juices collect and the chicken remains moist.

I love the flavour the wine gives to the pan juices but feel free to substitute with broth if you would prefer no alcohol. When I’m serving this chicken with rice or a simple salad I usually just serve it with the pan juices. If I’m serving it with my mashed potatoes I take the extra few minutes to make the simple gravy included in the recipe below. It’s easy and tasty and so good over mashed potatoes. This is a recipe I have been making a lot and of all the basic recipes I have made and tried for a classic roast chicken it beats them out. Never dry and bland. Always perfectly golden, crispy, and juicy.  It’s a recipe from Nagi (Recipe Tin Eats) that is my go too - I just switch up the seasoning and the herbs according to what I have on hand at the moment. It’s simple to make and flavorful, the perfect roast for Sunday lunch but easy and quick enough to make for a weeknight - the leftovers are always wonderful too.
