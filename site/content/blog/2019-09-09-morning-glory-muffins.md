Fruit and nut muffins are my favourite kind of muffins. Morning glory muffins are made with a little bit of everything and taste like spiced apple cake and moist carrot cake combined. They are chock-full of goodies like coconut, apple, carrots and nuts, seeds and yet don’t feel too loaded. All the flavours work together creating a fabulous little muffin and great start to the day, a delicious grab-and-go snack or great "eat in the car" treat.

I made this recipe in partnership with Bob’s Red Mill to showcase their brand new line of Pan-Baked Granolas. They come in 4 different flavours and are fabulous. Although all 4 granolas are delicious on their own for breakfast or as a snack, I thought I would get creative and use them in unique and delicious ways. For this recipe I used Bob’s Red Mill Pan-Baked <span class="highlight"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.bobsredmill.com/coconut-spice-pan-baked-granola.html">Coconut Spice Granola</a></span> as a crunchy crumble topping.

As soon as I tasted this granola with the coconut and spice I immediately thought of morning glory muffins and thought instead of making a crumble for the muffins this granola would make for the perfect topping. They were a perfect fit. There are endless variations of morning glory muffins out there. This version is one of my go to’s. But there are a lot of things that you can change with this recipe. I know some versions have pineapple in them others have more seeds in them and some even have more spice  in them. Feel free to customize these babies to suit your taste!

They also freeze really well and are great for meal prep. I love having a batch of these always in the freezer. I thaw them over night and they make a great brekkie on the go. The also make a nice treat with your afternoon tea or make fo a great breakfast in bed. This is a super simple recipe that I’m surprised I have never shared on the blog before, cause this is one of my fav muffins. Im so glad they are finally on the blog and I hope you give them a go.

### Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 375°F. Lightly grease a 12-cup muffin tin, or line it with papers 
1. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking soda, spices, cranberries and salt.
1. Add in the carrots, apple, coconut, nuts, and sunflower seeds and toss with your hands or a fork until all the shredded apples and carrots are coated 
1. In a separate bowl whisk together the eggs, oil, vanilla, and orange juice really well until frothy and well combined
1. Add the wet mixture to the flour mixture, and stir with spatula or wooden spoon until evenly moistened.
1. Divide the batter among the wells of the prepared pan (I like to use a cookie scoop) 
1. Sprinkle each muffin evenly with Bobs Red Mill Pan-Baked Coconut Spice Granola 
1. Bake the muffins for 20-25 minutes, until they're nicely domed and a cake tester inserted in one of the muffins comes out clean.
1. Remove from the oven, let cool for 5 minutes in their pan on a rack, then slip them out of the pan to finish cooling. Wrap any leftovers airtight, and store at room temperature for up to 2-3 days; freeze for longer storage.
