It’s best not to mess with a classic - especially if it yields the tastiest batch of oatmeal cookies every single time. You will love the textures in these oatmeal cookies and their rich buttery flavor. They’re just one of those classic cookies everyone will love and you’ll want to make them over and over again. Chewy in the middle with crispy edges - make them with raisins or chocolate chips. They are quick & simple and require no chilling.

It’s my favorite recipe I have been using forever from Canadian Living magazine. It’s one of those recipes you try once and that is it - you never look at another oatmeal cookie recipe. It’s basic and delicious and I just adjusted the leavening agent a little and to make them gluten free I used <span class="highlight"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.bobsredmill.com/gluten-free-1-to-1-baking-flour.html">Gluten Free 1-to-1 Baking Flour</a></span> and <span class="highlight"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.bobsredmill.com/gluten-free-organic-old-fashioned-rolled-oats.html">Bob’s Red Mill Gluten Free Organic Old Fashioned Rolled Oats</a></span>. Their 1-1 gluten free flour is my favorite. It works as the perfect substitute to all-purpose flour.

I have used all-purpose flour in this recipe and Bob’s Red Mill gluten free flour in its place and both work perfectly in this recipe. When I do make them to share no one ever can tell that they are gluten free. That is a good gauge to a great GF 1-1 baking flour. Bob’s Red Mill has you covered when it comes to all of your baking needs while catering to those in your family who have specific food allergies. Their flours come in stone-ground, whole grain, organic, gluten free, paleo, and vegan options, perfect for any spring recipes.

## How to make oatmeal chocolate chip cookies

They are quick and easy to make. 

1. Whisk the dry ingredients together except for the old fashioned rolled oats 
2. Cream the butter with the sugars until fluffy. Careful not to soften butter fully or to warm it. Semi-firm butter is best and will help cookies spread less.
3. Add the dry ingredients into the wet and mix until just  combined 
4. Fold in the oatmeal and chocolate chips or raisins 
5. Scoop out the dough with a cookie scoop. Using the cookie scoop (2tbsp) is the easiest way to make these cookies uniform in size and easier to handle as the dough can get sticky
6. Roll the dough from the scoop into balls and place on a lined baking sheet. 
7. Bake the cookies until the edges are set and golden. The centre will still look unset and that is fine - they will continue to bake even after coming out of the oven while they sit on the hot baking sheet. Make sure to bake them with the oven rack placed in the middle of the oven. 
8. Allow them to cool in the baking pan 2-5 minutes and then transfer them directly to cooling rack to cool completely.

Cookie baking tips:  

Cookies can be a bit finicky sometimes. You have all your ingredients and you have read through all the directions carefully and then you bake them and they are not quite right and you just don’t know what went wrong. Here are a few things to help trouble shoot when baking a fresh batch.  Each recipe can have a slight variation and that is why it’s important to try and stick as closely to the directions in the recipe.  There are a few things that can effect the baking time and things to keep in mind.

</br>
</br>

Size matters:  

The size you make the cookies will affect the baking time. Making them larger than the recipe calls for will require longer baking time and vice versa.

Oven rack placement:  

It’s important to bake them in the middle of the oven for consistent baking results. Most cookie recipes will let you know specifically where to place the rack - it will affect baking time and could cause cookies to burn if rack is low and baking time isn’t adjusted.

Baking sheet choice:  

What you bake them on makes a difference too. Ideally choose a baking pan that is heavy-gauge, dull and light (in colour) aluminum. It doesnt have to be fancy but the ones to avoid are dark nonstick ones and the very thin ones. The dark ones absorb extra heat – which causes cookies to burn or overbrown. The thin cookie sheets warp easily which means they'll heat unevenly affecting the baking time on your cookies.

* <span itemprop="ingredients">Flaky sea salt for sprinkling (optional) </span>

### Directions

1. Preheat oven to 350°F. Line 2 large baking sheets with parchment paper and set aside. Make sure baking rack is placed so that cookies bake in the middle of the oven not the lower third. 

1. In a medium size bowl whisk together flour, cinnamon, baking soda and salt. 

1. In large bowl, beat together butter, brown sugar and granulated sugar until fluffy, about 2 minutes using a standing mixer or hand mixer. 

1. Beat in egg; beat in egg yolk and vanilla. 

1. Then add the flour mixture in a bit at a time and continue mixing until just combined. 

1. Stir in oats and chocolate chips or raisins with a wooden spoon or spatula 

1. Roll dough by 2 tbsp into balls. Arrange, 2 inches apart, on prepared pans. Bake, 1 pan at a time, until golden, 12 to 14 minutes. Let cool on pans on racks for 2 minutes; transfer directly to racks to cool completely.
2. For extra melty chocolate chip puddles use the 2 extra tablespoons of chocolate chips to gently press a couple of them into each cookie as they cool in the pan. Sprinkle with flakey sea salt if using (Totally optional)

</br>

### Storage instructions

* Be sure to store them in a well sealed airtight container at room temperature. They stay fresh covered at room temperature for up to 1 week.
</br>
</br>

### Make Ahead & Freezing Instructions

You can make the dough and chill it in the refrigerator for up to 4 days. Allow to come to room temperature then bake as normal. Baked cookies freeze well wrapped tightly for up to 3 months. Unbaked cookie dough balls freeze well for up to 3 months. To bake frozen cookie dough balls just bake for for an extra minute, no need to thaw.
