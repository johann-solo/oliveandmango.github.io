excerpt: Creamy, flavourful cheese sauce without any of the bad stuff
---

I have never wanted to dive into any food substance other than a big vat of Nutella until I met up with this cheese sauce via Nagi over at _Recipe Tin Eats_. I often talk about Nagi - her recipes are the best and she makes them very easy to adapt and she has the cutest doggie! If you aren’t following her yet then you should!

I made a few tweaks to her recipe to suit our tastes and this sauce pretty much means the end to buying weird room temperature creamy cheese in a jar from the grocery store. What is in that stuff anyways? It doesn’t matter cause you never have to think about that stuff again after making this yummy sauce.

There is no cheat method when it comes to making this sauce so get ready to use a little elbow grease to shred your own cheese. Do not buy and use the pre-shredded kind. Those have an additive that just doesn’t allow for a nice creamy consistency when it comes to this sauce. If you want a perfectly creamy and delicious sauce then you gotta put in the work.

I love this sauce chunky but there is an alternative to make  it smoother. You can purée your veggies once they are cooked through and then add them back into the pot before adding the evaporated milk and cheese mixture. You can do the same with the green chilies before adding them in as well. It may alter the colour of the sauce a bit but it will be an even creamier consistency as opposed to a chunkier cheese sauce.  I love the texture of it and so I just chop everything finely and leave it that way without pureeing.

They flavour of all the add ins is really what makes this cheese sauce stand out. They bring a flavour  party to the sauce and are perfect over nachos as well as in tacos, burritos, a drizzle over your chili, by the spoonful.......just saying!

It’s super easy to whip up once you have all your ingredients chopped and shredded and it’s stores well. You can adjust the consistency by adding more milk. It does thicken over time so you can reheat if needed and thin it out a bit. If I’m making it ahead I will allow it too cool and then pour it into a jar and seal and refrigerate it. It’s stays creamy even after refrigerating but you can make it even creamier by reheating it and adjusting consistency to your liking.
