This Chocolate Pudding Recipe is chocolatey, rich, decadent and velvety smooth. It’s very easy to make and takes minutes with options to make on the stove top or in the microwave. It’s a hundred times better than boxed pudding mix. Dress up this simple Chocolate Pudding with a dollop of whipped cream and shaved chocolate or cocoa powder, and its the perfect dessert for any occasion.

It can easily be made ahead (up to 3 days) and chilled until needed. I have to admit that there are many time I have made this and couldn’t wait for my portion to be chilled and enjoyed spoonful after spoonful of it while it was still warm and sometimes right out of the pot - its so good. You must try it. Warm pudding almost has a different flavor than chilled pudding, with each being terrific in their own way. You won’t be able to get enough. It’s ultra rich and creamy! And flavor wise, it has a deep chocolate flavour, with a hint of espresso, and a Baileys Irish Cream kick! The Baileys isn’t too over powering but adds a really nice flavour to this pudding. Without it - makes this my faithful and favourite chocolate pudding. With it - makes it a special version of it.

### Ingredients to make this Simple Homemade Chocolate Pudding
To make this pudding you will need:
* Cornstarch: Acts as a thickening agent. I have not tried it with tapioca starch or any other thickening agent. 
* Granulated Sugar: Adds the sweetness to this pudding. 
* Whole milk: Full-Fat whole milk is a must here. I never get the same texture with low fat milk or non dairy. 
* Baileys Irish Cream: You can use a classic Baileys, or you can make a batch of my [homemade Irish cream](https://www.oliveandmango.com/homemade-irish-cream/) on the blog. If you want to omit the Baileys from this recipe, no problem - tips on doing so below in recipes notes. 
* Chocolate: This is the star ingredient in this chocolate pudding so I always recommend choosing a good quality chocolate for this recipe. I recommend semi-sweet chocolate or dark chocolate. The darker the chocolate  the richer the flavour will be. I would not recommend milk chocolate. 
* Espresso Powder: Enhances the flavour of the chocolate and overall pudding - I always love to add it to my chocolte recipes. But if you want to skip it that is fine - no need to substitute it with anything.
* Salt: A pinch of salt in anything sweet always balances and enhances the flavours. 
* Pure Vanilla Extract: Always adds the perfect flavour to anything sweet and chocolatey. I have to experiment with other extracts. I bet this would be so good with peppermint or orange extract too.

#### Toppings (optional):
* Whipped cream 
* Shaved chocolate 

### Directions
#### Stove Top Version
1. In a medium size sauce pan whisk together the cornstarch, sugar, espresso powder if using and salt. Slowly drizzle in the milk while whisking to smooth out any lumps, then more quickly once the cornstarch mixture is smooth and incorporated. 
1. Place over medium-low heat and whisk occasionally for 10-12 ( should not reach a simmer) At this point it should start to thicken, enough that it will coat the back of a spoon. 
1. Whisk in the chocolate, and continue stirring for another 2 to 4 minutes, until chocolate is fully incorporated, stir in Baileys and continue to cook a couple more minutes until thick (increase heat slightly if needed). Then remove from heat and stir in vanilla. 
1. Distribute among individual pudding cups or one large serving bowl, and chill until it is cool and set, approx 2-3 hours. *To avoid pudding skin: Put plastic on top of the pudding and smooth it gently against the surface of it before refrigerating.
1. Once set remove plastic warp if using and enjoy. Pudding can refrigerated in a sealed container for up to 3 days.

#### Microwave Version
1. Whisk together the sugar, corn starch and espresso powder really well in a large microwaveable bowl. Then whisk in milk really well and microwave 2 minutes 
1. Remove and whisk really well and microwave again for another 2 min  
1. Whisk in the chocolate until it’s mostly dissolved along with the vanilla and the Baileys and then microwave for 1 minute.
1. Remove - and mixture should be slightly thicker  now - whisk again and microwave for another 1 minute. Repeat 1 min at a time until its nice and thick. Then pour into cups or one large serving bowl, and chill until it is cool and set, approx 2-3 hours. *To avoid pudding skin: Put plastic on top of the pudding and smooth it gently against the surface of it before refrigerating.

### Recipe Notes
* If you still have a few lumps in your pudding after its off the heat feel free to pass it through a fine mesh sieve. (Whisking while it cooks should prevent any lumps in your paddling though)
* The espresso powder and the Baileys are completely optional - they add loads of flavours and richness to this chocolate pudding but you don’t have to add them in. If you decide to forgo the Baileys just top up the milk to 3 cups to make up for the loss. No need to replace the espresso powder with anything. If you want it even more boozier or with a more intense Baileys flavour - then you can increase the Baileys amount to &frac12; cup and reduce the milk to 2&frac12; cups
