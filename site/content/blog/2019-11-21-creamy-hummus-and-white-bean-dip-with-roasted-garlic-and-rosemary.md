These are two of my all time favourite recipes for your basic hummus and white bean dip. Both of these dips are classic dips/spreads that always make it on my charcuterie or veggie platters. Actually I make the hummus quite often as I love it for snacking on with veggies and crisps or slathering it on a sandwich too. It turns out so creamy every time and is so flavourful.

Let's talk specifically about the hummus first. I’m a firm believer that to make a fabulously creamy hummus - like next level creaminess, you must make it from dry chickpeas as opposed to canned. Do not get me wrong I still make it with canned when I want to make it in a pinch but for a truly creamy one I plan ahead and soak my beans to make from dry. It makes a lot of difference in texture and flavour. To make it even creamier still and if you have the patience for it, once you cook your chickpeas, separate and remove the chickpea skins. This is a lot of work but for an ultra silky smooth hummus it’s worth it – if you have the time and patience. I have only done this once for experimental purposes. Never again - this is creamy enough for me. I neither have the time or patience to remove the skins. I love this _Bon Appetit_ recipe for the fact that the flavours are distinct and fabulous but mellow. The garlic isn’t pungent. It’s there giving flavour but not overpowering thanks to the fact that it’s whizzed in the processor first with the lemon juice and then strained. It’s just the yummiest hummus - you will love it.

Ok so now let’s chat about this white bean dip. I know I know - I didn’t use dried beans for this one but you can for a creamy dreamy dip. When it comes to the white bean dip I don’t mind a bit of body to it so I love the recipe from _Food52_. It turns out perfect every time loaded with flavour from the roasted garlic and the rosemary. The roasted garlic is a must - it gives it that wonderful sweet garlic nutty flavour instead of a hard pungent hit of it if you used raw. You just can’t beat the flavours of roasted garlic. The rosemary also gets blended into the mix so you really get the flavour of it. It’s simple it’s delicious and just so good with the veggies but also great with pita chips too.

So there you go! I recently took this to an anniversary/slash go away party for my brother In law and his wife specifically thinking of my mother in law who is vegan and sometimes at events like that there aren’t too many grazing boards or appetisers that don’t involve cheese in them. You really can’t go wrong with a platter like this for any diet. And to my surprise there were actually more than a handful of vegans there that night so it was well enjoyed. It seems a few had recently watched The Game Changers and were enlightened. Expect more and more to be and bring this hummus and bean dip to your next gathering!

### For the Hummus 
Makes approx 2-3 cups
</br>

### Ingredients

* <span itemprop="ingredients">1 cup dried chickpeas</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">2 teaspoons baking soda, divided</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">4 garlic cloves, unpeeled</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">⅓ cup freshly squeezed lemon juice plus more according to taste </span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">1 teaspoon salt, plus more according to taste </span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">⅔ cup tahini</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">¼ teaspoon ground cumin plus more according to taste </span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">Olive oil (for serving)</span>

### Directions

1. Place chickpeas and 1 tsp. baking soda in a medium bowl and add cold water to cover by 2". Cover and let sit at room temperature until chickpeas have doubled in size, 8–12 hours. I usually soak mine overnight. Drain and rinse.
1. Combine soaked chickpeas and remaining 1 tsp. baking soda in a large saucepan and add cold water to cover by at least 2". Bring to a boil, skimming surface as needed. Reduce heat to medium-low, partially cover, and simmer until chickpeas are tender and completely falling apart, 45–60 minutes. (The longer they have soaked - the less time they need to cook to soften). Once done drain and set aside.
1. Meanwhile, process garlic, lemon juice, and 1 tsp. salt in a food processor until coarsely puréed; let sit 10 minutes to allow garlic to mellow.
1. Strain garlic mixture through a fine-mesh sieve into a small bowl, pressing on solids to release as much liquid as possible. Return liquid to food processor and discard solids. Add tahini and pulse to combine. Pour in ¼ cup ice water by the tablespoonful through the opening and process (it may seize up at first) until mixture is very smooth, pale, and thick. Add chickpeas and cumin and process, occasionally scraping down sides, until mixture is extremely smooth, about 4 minutes. Thin with more water if you prefer a looser consistency; taste and season with salt, more lemon juice, and more cumin as desired.
1. Spoon hummus into a shallow bowl, making a well in the centre, and drizzle liberally with oil. Top with various chickpeas, chopped parsley or even just a sprinkle of paprika or extra cumin will do. 


### For the White Bean Dip
Makes approx 1.5-2 cups 
</br>
</br>

### Ingredients

* <span itemprop="ingredients">One 15-19 ounce can of white beans</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">2 teaspoons minced rosemary plus more for garnish </span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">2&frac12; teaspoons freshly squeezed lemon juice</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">&frac12; teaspoon cumin</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling on after </span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">4 cloves of roasted garlic</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">salt & pepper to taste</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">roasted garlic</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">1 whole garlic bulb</span>

### Directions

1. Pre-heat the oven to 400°F. Remove the papery outer layer of garlic without taking apart the bulb. Cut-off the top fifth of the bulb, exposing the inside of the cloves. 
2. Drizzle with olive oil, wrap in aluminium foil, and seal it closed. Cook for 40 minutes, or until a fork can easily pass through. 
3. In a food processor, add rinsed beans, roasted garlic, lemon, olive oil, cumin, rosemary, salt and pepper to taste and pulse mix to a smooth consistency. 
4. Transfer to a shallow serving bowl, smooth-out with the backside of spoon, dress with olive oil and rosemary.
