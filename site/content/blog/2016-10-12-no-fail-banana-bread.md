This super-moist, soft crumb, buttery banana flecked bread is my favorite banana bread recipe of all time. You need 4 ripe bananas and the chocolate chips and nuts are optional but add extra flavour and texture to your banana bread. The nuts can be substituted with seeds or left out all together if allergies are a concern. I love to have  it still warm out of the oven or toasted with a smear of salted butter over it. It’s easy to make and is a hit with everyone.

Have you ever searched ‘Best Banana Bread’ on Pinterest or google? There’s literally hundreds and even possibly thousands of recipes that claim they are the best. There are so many takes on banana bread. Nuts, no nuts. Chocolate chips, no chips. Butter no butter but instead oil or vice versa. Gluten free, vegan, paleo, pumpkin and the list goes on and on and on! I have tried many different recipes. This is the one I make over and over and me and my family never tire of, and any time I share it with someone or bring it to work its always a hit.

I think banana bread is one of those foods that people have different opinions on. I had a friend who’s idea of banana bread was from a box mix so her taste was a bit different when it came to banana bread. Like any food its all relative to your exposure , “my mom made it this way”, or like my friend you love your box mix version.  I’m not going to be the judge of tastes and preferences but i will tell you why I love this recipe. Here is why I think this one is the best banana bread recipe I have tried thus far:

* The base recipe always turns out perfect and the same every time
* The original recipe called for pecans but its a versatile recipe and I have switched the pecans out to walnuts hazelnuts and even seeds and also added chocolate chips 
* It always turns out perfectly moist
* It’s not too sweet
* Every time someone tries it they must have the recipe. (A very good sign)
* Recipe uses basic pantry ingredients which is always such a bonus

The original recipe is from the food network by _Tyler Florence_. I adapted it because I find the part of that recipe that says to separate the 4 bananas and prepare in two batches doesn’t work for me. The consistency doesn’t come out the way I like it so I don’t separate the bananas. I blend all four together as you see in the recipe. I also almost always add chocolate chips. I love the crunch from the pecans or walnuts if your swapping, and the little surprise crunch and burst of sweetness when you bite into a chocolate chip. Definitely feel free to try the recipe on the food network website and compare for yourself. In the meantime I hope you enjoy this recipe which is my favourite banana bread recipe. A classic and a favourite of anyone I have made it for too. Can’t beat that right! Let me know if you have a favourite recipe for this classic. I would love to know and I’m always willing to try other recipes for it.

### Ingredients

* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 cups all-purpose flour</span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1½ teaspoons baking soda</span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">½ teaspoon salt</span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 overripe bananas</span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup sugar</span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">¾ cup (1½ sticks) unsalted butter, melted and cooled</span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 large eggs</span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">½ cup pecans, finely chopped plus more for topping (optional) </span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">½ cup semi-sweet chocolate chips plus more for topping (optional)</span>

### Directions

1.	Preheat oven to 350°F and lightly grease or line a 9 by 5-inch loaf pan with parchment paper. 
2.	In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt; set aside.
3.	Place bananas in a large mixing bowl and use a fork to mash them a little or break them up into smaller pieces. Add the sugar and beat until very creamy for a good 3 minutes.
4.	Add the melted butter, eggs, and vanilla; beat well and scrape down the sides of the bowl.
5.	Mix in the dry ingredients just until incorporated.
6.	Fold in the nuts, chocolate chips with a rubber spatula.
7.	Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan. Give the pan a good rap on the counter to get any air bubbles out.
8.	Slice a banana thinly lengthwise and lay down two pieces over banana bread cut side down and press gently. Or simply scatter some extra nuts and chocolate chips overtop. (Optional and decorative)
9.	Bake for approximately 1 hour and 15 minutes, or until golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the centre of the loaf comes out clean. Tent with foil if it starts to darken too quickly. 
10.	Cool the bread in the pan for 10 minutes or so, and then turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely before slicing. Cover and store banana bread at room temperature for 2 days or in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.
