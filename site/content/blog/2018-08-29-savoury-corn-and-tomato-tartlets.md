excerpt: Lightly herbed and buttery crust envelope this tasty sweet and savoury corn
---

These savoury tarts are filled with Summer’s bounty. Lightly herbed and buttery crust envelope the tastiest sweet and savoury filling. The sweetness comes from the fresh corn along with the grape tomatoes that are sweet with a slight tang. They pair well those two! The red onion adds some extra flavor and sweetness as well. The creamy herb and garlic cheese layer is the perfect layer for all those flavours to sink into and the mozzarella binds them together and adds some more richness to it. Just my kind of tartlets!

Savoury tarts and galettes totally have to be my weakness! I love fruit filled ones too, don’t get me wrong, but I have my fill of them after a bite or two. Not the same with savoury ones, especially ones filled with end of summer fresh and delicious ingredients.

I decided to switch up the crust a bit from my usual one and experiment with blending flours. I found a recipe for this rye cornmeal blend in _Food and Wine_ and thought it would be perfect with the tomato and corn filling that I wanted to use in it. I am so glad I did. We loved the texture and the flavour from the cornmeal as well. The original recipe for the crust was used for something sweet but I used the exact recipe and added thyme to it and it was perfect for these savoury tartlets. Don’t let the sugar mess you up in the recipe - it’s suppose to be in there. It’s not in any way overly sweet and works well with the filling. You can definitely use any all-purpose in the recipe if rye is hard to come by where you live and it will definitely work. But if you have a _Bulk Barn_ near you like I do now (jumping for joy) then most definitely try this flour blend - you will love it!

The dough also comes together very quickly in the food processor – which is a bonus. I made the filling while the dough was resting in the fridge and it was enough time for it to cool completely before filling the tartlets. It must be cooled completely. Don’t try and fill the tarts while the filling is still warm because the dough will start to get overly soft and way too hard to work with. If at any point that happens just stop what you’re doing with them and refrigerate them on the baking sheet for a while for the fats to set in the dough which will make the dough easier to work with.

I’m savouring all of the tomatoes right now! We didn’t have all the varieties of tomatoes we have here in Trinidad so it’s been so fun enjoying the different varieties. I will be eating tomatoes all year round of course because they are available all year round here, as with many places, but there is something sweeter and tastier about them when you eat them in season, fresh from the market, local and even better homegrown or from one of the local farms. Those are the ones I’m savouring especially. Bursting with flavour and perfect cooked into the tartlets or uncooked in a salad or sandwich. Hope you are enjoying the bounty that is in season in your area and if you get an opportunity to make these tartlets I absolutely recommended it.
