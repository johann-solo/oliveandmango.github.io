A delicious chicken recipe that comes together quickly, making it perfect for the midweek. This cider braised chicken incorporates some of my favourite things of the Fall season - apples and apple cider! I can always use another chicken recipe and I wanted one that would incorporate those Fall ingredients.

This is the one I found and love from _Canadian Living_. There a quite a few out there but this was by far my favourite as it’s one of the easiest and with the most minimal ingredient list. I changed up a few small things according to my taste but the basic structure of this meal is the same across the board from what I have searched and found when it comes to braised chicken in cider.

The original recipe called for serving this dish with smashed potatoes which would be equally as delicious as this cauliflower mash but I had just purchased cauliflower and thought it would be great to make the mash. The gravy or sauce from the chicken and apples was sooo good and went well with the cauliflower mash but would be wonderful with any mash and even over rice if you wanted a different option.

I used the pre packaged cauliflower rice because it was handy and quick but the recipe below describes how to prep cauliflower rice from a head of cauliflower. I was on a time frame and needed to make dinner as quickly as possible and the prepackaged stuff worked perfectly. You can even use frozen cauliflower but you may have to knock off a minute or two from the cooking time as it will get tender slightly faster than fresh as frozen is usually cooked slightly before it’s frozen.

I have also learned that sautéing the cauliflower rice before cooking it not only adds extra flavour to it but also helps it boil faster once the water is added to the pot. You want to use just enough water to cover the cauliflower when cooking so that the cauliflower doesn’t get soggy. Most of the water will cook off during the process but you will have to drain the rest off, reserving a little to drizzle in and loosen up the mash while you mash, blend or process the cauliflower. Instead of the cooking water you could add in whole milk or cream but that isn’t necessary for a creamy cauliflower mash. It can be added for extra flavour though.

You don’t have to worry about over mashing the cauliflower- it doesn’t behave the same way as potatoes. They stay creamy and become creamier the more you mash them or process them, unlike potatoes that can get sort of gummy if over mashed. If you have never tried making cauliflower mash, I strongly recommend it. You will be surprised at how smooth and delicious it is with very little add ins.

This was a hit with my family and I was happy to add another delicious chicken recipe to the list of ones I have and love to make especially when you want a quick and easy dinner. Thighs cook up quicker than breasts that is why I chose them in this recipe and they are by far more flavourful than breast meat - that’s what I think anyways. If you’re a fan of apples in savoury dishes you will love this and if you aren’t or have never had them in anything savoury you are missing out and hope you give this recipe a try!
