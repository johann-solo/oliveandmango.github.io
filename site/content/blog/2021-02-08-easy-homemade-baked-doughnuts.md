These homemade doughnuts are such an easy bake up and the best morning treat. I would say they are just as easy and as quick to make as pancake batter. They are a very light flavorful baked doughnut. All you need is a couple of mixing bowls, a spatula and a doughnut pan. If you don’t own one, (I think they are worth the splurge) you can make them in a muffin tin or mini bundt tins. You can have fresh baked donuts in under 30 minutes which are a smidge healthier for you as they are baked not fried. Plus they are so pretty, and so fun to make and decorate - they are sure to put a smile on just about anyone’s face. I have included all sorts of substitutions and even how to make these vegan in the recipe notes below and also loads of options for topping this tasty base doughnut recipe.

These baked doughnuts are not fried, so there’s going to definitely be a difference in texture. But these still have a great texture and the taste is very similar. Make sure to have fun with this recipe and do a variation of toppings. These are especially fun to make with the kids - and loads of sprinkles. So how those two things go hand in hand. I chose to dip these guys into two different glazes. One of them is my all time favorite - a thick decadent chocolate glaze then topped with sprinkles. The second is a blood orange glaze with sprinkles. The blood orange glaze gives them a blush pink hue and a slight citrus note that is always welcome. You will love those two but feel free to experiment with some of the others I listed below.

## How to make baked doughnuts
They are just so easy to whip up - two bowls and a spatula is all you need. 
* Make the simple  batter. Whisk the dry ingredients in one bowl and the wet ingredients in another bowl. Pour the wet into the dry and mix to combine both. 
* Fill the donut cavities. Transferring donut batter into the donut pan is easier than you think. You can either transfer the batter into a piping bag or large ziploc bag, trim off a bottom corner, and squeeze the batter into the pan. Or you can transfer the batter into a measuring cup with spout and pour it into the cavities. Lastly you can also just use a spoon and patiently spoon out the batter into them.  
* Bake. Give the pan a little tap on the counter to release any air pockets if you wish and then bake.
* Make your topping. This is the fun part. Choose a glaze or topping from below and get it ready for the doughnuts while they bake.
* Dip doughnuts into the topping. Dip the doughnuts into the glaze and then cover in sprinkles if using.

### Directions
#### For the doughnuts
* Preheat the oven to 350°F. Spray or grease 2 doughnut pans well. (I used a 2.8 Inch 12-cavity Doughnut Pan) 
* In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt. 
* In a small bowl, whisk together the egg, milk, melted butter, and vanilla. Stir the wet mixture into the dry ingredients until just combined.
* Spoon or pour batter into the baking pans, filling each one a little more than three-quarters full or just below the edge of pan. Bake for 17-20 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean. Allow to cool for 5 minutes, then tap the doughnuts out onto a sheet pan.
* Allow them too cool before dipping or topping. Topping options below. 
* Donuts taste best eaten the same day, though they may be covered tightly and stored at room temperature for 2 days.

#### Blood Orange Glaze
* Combine the confectioners' sugar, honey and 4 tablespoons of the juice in a bowl. Add more juice little by little until the mixture is spreadable (you might not need the full remaining tablespoon). Dip doughnuts halfway into the glaze and then allow excess glaze to drip off. Sprinkle the tops with sprinkles and enjoy.

#### Chocolate Glaze
* Place the chocolate, and cream in a medium bowl. Melt in 20 second increments in the microwave, stirring after each time, until completely melted and smooth. Dip the tops of the donuts into the chocolate glaze and then cover with sprinkles and enjoy 

#### Basic cinnamon sugar topping
* 4 tablespoons (&frac12; stick) unsalted butter 
* &frac12; cup sugar 
* &frac12; teaspoon ground cinnamon 
* Melt the butter in an 8-inch saute pan. Combine the sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl. Dip each doughnut first in the butter and then in the cinnamon sugar, either on one side or both sides.

#### White chocolate glaze 
* 1 &frac12; tablespoons Heavy cream 
* &frac12; cup chopped White chocolate or chips (approx 90-100g) 
* 1-2 drops of natural food coloring) optional (directions same as chiclet glaze) 

#### Powdered
* Gently toss warm donuts in 1 cup confectioners' sugar until evenly dusted. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely; reserve bowl with sugar. Toss cooled donuts in sugar again until thoroughly coated. 

#### Powdered Sugar Glaze
* Mix 1 cup confectioners' sugar with 2 tablespoons whole milk; tint with gel food coloring, if desired. Dip top of each donut in glaze (donut should be halfway submerged), turning as needed to evenly coat. Transfer to a wire rack. * Top with sprinkles; let dry completely.

#### Coconut
* Mix 1 cup confectioners' sugar with &frac14; cup whole milk. Dip donuts completely in glaze to coat, then use a fork or chopstick to transfer to a wire rack. Sprinkle with toasted shredded coconut; let dry completely.

### Recipe notes 
* Freezing Instructions: You can freeze the unfrosted donuts for up to 2 months. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator, warm up to your liking in the microwave, and top with glaze.
* As Muffins or using mini bundt pans: You can make this recipe into 8-10 muffins using a muffin pan. Bake at the same temperature for 18-20 minutes or until lightly browned.
* Make them dairy free & vegan: Substitute coconut oil or any vegetable oil for the butter and almond milk or other plant based milk for the whole milk. Can also be made vegan with and egg replacer.
* You can use buttermilk instead of regular milk and also cake flour for all purpose for an even fluffier texture.
