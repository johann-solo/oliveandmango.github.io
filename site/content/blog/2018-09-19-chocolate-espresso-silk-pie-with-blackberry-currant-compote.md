excerpt: Rich, chocolatey and silky smooth. Simple and so delicious
---

This pie is exactly the way it’s name suggests. Rich, chocolatey and silky smooth. I have been looking for a very simple chocolate silk pie recipe and this is the one you guys. It uses a simple graham cracker base which is made in a jiffy and the filling is whipped up in your mixer. Can’t get more delicious and simpler than that.

One thing that we should talk about but that we won’t dwell on too much is the use of uncooked eggs in the recipe. We won’t dwell on it too much as so many other desserts and dressings contain uncooked eggs in them like mousses, tiramisu, caesar dressing etc. The key to ‘safely’ using uncooked eggs is using the freshest possible pasteurized eggs with intact shells. I have made this and many many other uncooked egg recipes in my life and have served them without incidence so here’s hoping to that streak continuing. Hee hee! All jokes aside I have no problem with it and feel totally comfortable with the recipe and others that use uncooked eggs - if you are not than maybe this recipe isn’t for you. Check my [chocolate chess pie](https://www.oliveandmango.com/chocolate-chess-pie/) instead - it’s baked and also totally fabulous. Worth a look even if you are making this one too!

Moving on now. One of the best things about this recipe other than how fabulously silky smooth and melt in your mouth it is, is that the filling doesn’t need to be baked. The only baking required is for the crust which takes just minutes. Then you just whip up the filing while the crust cools and refrigerate and done.

I wanted to all mention that the compote goes wonderfully with the blackberries and the currants, adding a nice tart balance to the rich and sweet pie. I do understand though that you may not have these berries all year round and available to you. That is no problem. Use any frozen berry you have available and it will be a very delicious pairing with this silk pie. Feel free to decorate with whip cream as an alternative to the fresh berries, especially if you don’t have any fresh ones around anymore. I used the last of the gardens blackberries in this dessert but using frozen berries is perfect in the compote.

This has very quickly become one of those desserts that is a go to for dinner parties cause it’s nice and easy to make. I can totally make it ahead, (like the night before) and everyone loves it. Can’t beat that when it comes to a dessert that tastes and looks this good! Hope you love it! Do tag me or let me know if you give it a try.

## Recipe

### Ingredients

__For the graham cracker crust__

* 1&frac12; cups graham cracker crumbs
* 2 tbsp granulated sugar
* 6 tbsp (&frac34; stick) unsalted butter melted
* Pinch of salt

__For the filling__

* &frac34; cup unsalted butter, at room temperature
* 1 cup granulated sugar
* 3 ounces unsweetened chocolate, melted and cooled
* 3 tablespoons freshly brewed espresso, at room temperature
* &frac12; teaspoon pure vanilla extract
* 3 pasteurized large eggs, see note
* 1 9-inch graham cracker crust, pre-baked
* homemade whipped cream, for topping
* blackberry compote, for serving (recipe below) 

### Directions

1. Preheat oven to 350 &deg; F

2. In a large bowl whisk together the graham cracker crumbs, sugar and pinch of salt until combined.

3. Pour the melted butter over the crumbs and mix with a rubber spatula until the butter is evenly distributed. The mixture should clump easily when pressed together.

4. Spoon mixture into a 9 inch pie or tart plate and using your fingers, press he mixture on the bottom of the plate and up along the side of the plate making sure the bottom and sides are all even.

5. Bake until the shell is slightly browned approx 5-7 minutes. Remove it from the oven and allow it to cool completely on a rack before filling

6. In the meantime make the filing. Cream together the butter and sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment (or in a large bowl using a handheld electric mixer on medium-high speed) until it is light and fluffy, about 4 minutes.

7. Scrape down the side of the bowl with a rubber spatula and add the melted chocolate.
8. Mix on high until the mixture is very fluffy, 5 minutes. While the mixer is still running, add the espresso and vanilla and continue to mix for another minute.
9. Turn the speed down to medium and add the eggs one at a time, beating for 3 minutes after each addition. After the addition of the third egg, the mixture should be lighter in color and smoother and silkier in texture.
10. Spoon the filling into the cooled graham cracker crust, smooth the top with a spatula and refrigerate uncovered for at least 4 hours or overnight. 
11. Before serving, top with the whipped cream and serve cold with the blackberry compote on top or alongside.

### Recipe Notes 
This recipe calls for raw eggs. Unpasteurized eggs may contain harmful bacteria, so please make sure you use pasteurized eggs. They are available at most supermarkets.

__For the blackberry currant compote__

* &frac14; cup granulated sugar (alternatively use 2-3 tbsp of maple syrup or date syrup which is what I used for this one)

* A pinch of ground cinnamon

* 1&frac12; tsp of cornstarch

* &frac12; cup of water

* 1 tsp brewed espresso or strong coffee (optional)

* 1 cup of fresh or frozen blackberries

* &frac12; cup of currants (alternatively you can do all blackberries or other berries)

### Directions

1. In a small bowl whisk together the sugar, cinnamon, cornstarch.

1. Add half cup of water and espresso or coffee if using and whisk well until smooth

1. Place the berries and currants in a medium saucepan, add the sugar mixture and cook over medium low heat stirring often to prevent scorching until the berries start to break down and soften and thicken enough to coat the back of a spoon - approx 7-10 minutes. 
1. Let the mixture come to a boil for 1 minute while stirring and then remove pan from heat and allow to cool completely before spooning over pie.
