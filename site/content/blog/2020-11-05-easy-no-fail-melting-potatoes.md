I was first introduced to this style potato when we did a shoot for thekitchn. We shot some absolutely delicious fondant potatoes for them. I couldn’t get over the buttery creaminess of those potatoes. While I loved the flavour I was on the search for a recipe that was a little more hands off and fully made in the oven for these delicious golden gems. I came a cross this fantastic recipe from Real Simple for melting potatoes and it did not fail me - easy and delicious and fully done in the oven. It’s almost like a pared down version of fondant potatoes.  Every time I make these I always get asked for the recipe so finally I  thought it was time to share it here.

The key to getting these potatoes right every time relies on a few things. First is to peel and soak your potatoes. Soaking them even for just the short 20 minutes removes excess potato starch from them, which helps achieve maximum crispness. That is what we want - crisp edges and a creamy interior. Roasting these melting potatoes at high heat ensures they get nice and crispy on the outside. Then, adding a little broth at the end allows the potatoes to absorb the liquid, making the insides extra moist and tender. They make the most perfect side to just about anything but I love to pair them with my [Simple Roasted chicken](https://www.oliveandmango.com/simple-roast-chicken/) and I make them to go with my [Chicken Marbella](https://www.oliveandmango.com/chicken-marbella/) every time. You are going to love them!
