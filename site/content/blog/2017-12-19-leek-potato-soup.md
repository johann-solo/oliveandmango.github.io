excerpt: A velvety and luscious classic soup
---

This is my husband’s favourite soup.  He never tires of it and it’s his most requested one.  I have to say I totally agree with him on this soup as well. It’s a classic and it’s so simple and quick to whip up.

You already know I’m a huge fan of leeks so no doubt I love this soup so much. I honestly think that the leeks actually make the soup in this case. Picture this soup without them. What are you left with? Just creamy potatoes – not bad but just not the same with the warmness and flavour the leeks add.

If you wanted to make this a vegan soup easily swap out the butter for more oil and the cream for coconut cream. It will still be as velvety and delicious. You can also swap the crispy bacon with some crispy pan fried mushrooms for a meaty texture along with the crispy croutons.

The only thing I would strongly recommend when making this soup is not to over blend when passing it through a blender or even when using the emersion one.  You do not want to get those potatoes going from silky smooth to gummy.  There is a fine line between the two and I strongly suggest not to over blend and cross it.

That is about it! Classic and delicious.  Everyone loves it and so that makes it the perfect starter for a dinner party too.  It’s a low effort soup with maximum yield and on repeat in our home and I’m sure it will be in yours once you try this super simple recipe! Enjoy!

### Ingredients
Serves 4

* 2 tbsp butter
* 1 tbsp olive oil
* Two leeks white and light green parts washed thoroughly and chopped
* 6 medium sized Potatoes peeled and diced
* 1 onion chopped
* 2 cloves of garlic minced
* 1 sprig of fresh thyme
* &frac14; cup of white wine (optional)
* 4&frac12; cups of broth plus more to thin the soup out if needed
* &frac14; cup heavy cream
<br>

### Directions

1. Heat the oil and butter in a large stock pot or heavy bottom Dutch oven and toss in and sauté the leeks and onion for a few minutes until they are soft and translucent.

1. Then add the thyme and garlic and sauté for another minute until fragrant. Add the wine and let it cook with the rest for a few minutes until it’s mostly reduced.

1. Add the chopped potatoes and broth, season with salt and pepper and bring to a boil.  Once at a boil, reduce the heat to a simmer and cover pot halfway and simmer until the potatoes are done and can easily be mashed with a fork on the side of the pot.

1. Remove soup from heat, remove the sprig of thyme and use an emersion blender to blend just until smooth. Do not over blend the soup or it will become gummy.

1. Stir in the cream and enjoy

1. Drizzle a little extra cream on top and serve with crispy croutons* and crispy bacon

### Recipe Notes

Homemade crispy croutons:

* Tear 4-5 pieces of your favourite bread (I used a corn loaf and you can def use a GF one too) into pieces and toss with 1-2 tbsp of olive oil and some salt and pepper to taste. (could add some thyme or rosemary for a little extra flavour too)
* Place on to a baking sheet and bake at 350 ° F for approx 10-15 minutes until golden tossing them once halfway though.
* Remove when done and set aside to cool complete and harden.
