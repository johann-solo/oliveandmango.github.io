excerpt: Bright and cheery with a delectable grapefruit cream cheese frosting and decorated with rosemary infused candied grapefruit

I was a little sad when I made these cupcakes because it was with my last batch of grapefruits for the season. Always sad to see the season go! I juiced so many grapefruits this season and I was loving it. I decided that I wanted to bake something with them. I decided on cupcakes because I was actually making them for a friend's game night. I thought cupcakes would be easier to feed a crowd playing games than having to slice cake and serve it out.

I actually love getting invited to things because obviously I love to be around friends but I also love using them as opportunities to try out new recipes. Sometimes they are a total fail (and that means picking something up from the grocery store on the way) and sometimes they are a win. These were a win for more reasons than one.  First they are really delicious especially if you're a fan of all things citrus! They are also super simple to make. The batter gets mixed with a spatula and the whole recipe is made of very basic ingredients. The yogurt and coconut oil makes them moist with a slight crumble and a little more dense than your regular cupcake.

I love the simplicity of the frosting too. There's just enough grapefruit infused in both the batter and the frosting without being too intense.  They aren't super tart or bitter if you are worried about that and you can use any variety of grapefruits you would like. I'm sure these would dazzle even more so especially when decorated with the candied grapefruit if you use the ruby red variety.  I didn't have any so I used the grapefruit available.

The candied grapefruit infused with rosemary is something I really wanted to test and that is why I added it.  I have always wanted to try it and this recipe for them was adapted by a recipe from pipandebby.com.  You can use this same recipe for making any kind of candied citrus slices.  It's the simplest one I have seen out there and all I did differently from the original recipe is infuse the sugar water with the rosemary which actually turned out wonderfully. But you don't have to infuse it with rosemary or anything.  That is totally an optional step.

The thing I would stress the most about this recipe is to slice the pieces of grapefruit as finely as possible.  A mandolin would be perfect but I don't have one so I used a sharp knife. A few of my pieces were a little on the thick side but they were still good.  They just didn't really dry as well as the thinner slices. Another must is to be patient and let them completely dry out. This recipe is great for decorating these cupcakes as well as other cakes but these would also be great dipped into chocolate and then eaten as a snack. You can also reserve the beautifully infused simple syrup leftover to use in cocktails. The syrup is fragrant being infused with beautiful citrus notes from the grapefruit as well as the Rosemary.

This is a pretty basic recipe overall and  I think you will enjoy adding it to your cupcake repertoire! This is a great recipe you can use with other citrus fruit too. We enjoyed these cupcakes and looking forward to the next grapefruit season so I can try this recipe again using different varieties of grapefruit. Hope you enjoy it- at least those of you who get to enjoy grapefruits all year round.
