excerpt: A hearty soup full of warm spices and plenty vegetables
---

Not another lentil soup you may say (eyes rolling). But this is no ordinary lentil soup. The warm spices in it give it so much flavour and sass and all the veggies make it hearty, filling and give it lots of colour and texture.  No doubt you already realise I have a love of lentils and all grains and legumes in general.  It’s always great when you can switch things up with them by just adding more spice.

I was given some geera or cumin sausages to try by a local company I know here in Trinidad and that is what inspired these spiced lentils. I thought sausages and kale and lentils go so well together but I wanted to enhance the spice in those sausages and came across Rachael Ray’s recipe which inspired this soup recipe.

Not all people love cumin. I am not one of those people. But I do realise it could be a  pretty intense or pungent spice for some. I think that the veggies along with the acidity from the tomatoes and the addition of curry really mellow it out or at least balance it.  Don’t get me wrong, cumin is still very present in this soup but it’s not all you taste.

It’s a hearty soup, one that both me and my husband loved. It’s full of veggies which I love, it’s filling as most lentil dishes are and full of so much protein and all of other good stuff, but it’s so flavourful and warming for the aromatic spices in it. If you love the flavours those spices bring, you will most definitely love this soup.

Feel free to use any sausage you like in it. If you are able to use the local ones here with the geera seasoning then most definitely do – you won’t be disappointed. But if not, there’s enough spice and flavour in this soup itself. I hope you enjoy this alternative way of making lentil soup.

### Ingredients

* 2 tbsp of olive oil
* 1 lb of sausages casings removed sweet or spicy (I used a jeera/geera sausage by Delmano)
* 4 cloves of garlic
* 1 large carrot peeled and chopped
* 3 stalks of celery chopped
* 2 onions chopped
* 2 sweet potatoes peeled and chopped into cubes
* &frac12; of a butternut squash peeled, seeds removed and chopped into cubes
* 2 tsp ground cumin
* 1 tsp curry powder of choice
* 1 tsp of fresh thyme
* a pinch of red pepper flakes
* 1 can of diced tomatoes
* 1&frac14; cups of rinsed and picked over brown lentils
* 6 cups of stock (chicken or vegetable) or water
* 1&frac12; cups of chopped kale or Swiss chard (I used purple kale in these pictures thus the darker colour)
* yoghurt, lemon wedges and chopped parsley or cilantro to top your lentils with
<br>

### Directions

1. In a soup pot or heavy bottom Dutch oven on medium heat, add the olive oil and sausage sautéing it until brown and breaking it into pieces

1. Once browned add in all the veggies including the onions and sauté for a few minutes until the onions are soft and translucent. Then add the garlic, cumin, curry, chili flakes and thyme and mix and sauté and stir for a minute or so until very fragrant. Then add the canned tomatoes and continue to stir for a minute or two until all the flavours are combined scraping the bottom of the pot.

1. Pour in the lentils and broth and stir well and season with salt and pepper. Bring pot to a boil and then lower heat to a simmer, cover pot with lid half way and let simmer for 30-35 minutes or until lentils are tender yet in tact.

1. Toss in the chopped kale and stir well and let simmer for another few minutes until kale has softened

1. Serve with crusty bread, a dollop of yoghurt, a squeeze of lemon juice and with some chopped parsley or cilantro

### Recipe Notes

If you want a soup with a creamy texture then before putting In the kale remove 1 cup of the soup (I usually pick out as much meat from the cup as possible) blend in a blender carefully using a towel over the lid so you don’t get burned and then pour it back into the soup and add your kale
