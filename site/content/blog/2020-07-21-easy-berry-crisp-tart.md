## How to make a crisp tart? 
It’s an easy one folks. It’s made up of a simple dough made with oats, <span class="highlight"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.bobsredmill.com/almond-meal-flour.html">almond flour</a></span> and butter. Combined they turn into a great little crumble that gets pressed into the pan and crumbled over the filling. Speaking of that filling - its a versatile one. I used Saskatoon berries in this one that a very sweet friend of mine picked and gave me. They have a bit of a tougher skin on them then blueberries and many bakers precook them before using them in pie but I don’t mind that they don’t break down fully in the pie. Some get very jammy and others stay whole. That won’t happen as much if you use blueberries, blackberries, strawberries or currants. They will breakdown into a jammier filling. Just a little FYI. The crumble gets nice and crunchy after it bakes up and the whole combination works really well with a scoop of vanilla icecream.

This tart is gluten free as it’s made with almond flour and gluten free old fashioned rolled oats from Bob’s Red Mill. The flavour and texture from both are perfect for this tart, both the base and the crumble. Bob’s Red Mill has all the products you need for all your baking needs while catering to those in your family who have specific food allergies with organic, gluten free, paleo, and vegan options - perfect for any summer recipe.

The whole recipe is versatile. If you would like to spice up the filling or the dough a little more feel free to add a pinch or two of cinnamon or cardamom. The cinnamon would be great for a fall version of this with apples or pears. And I love the cardamom with berries - a combo I used in my [spiced blueberry pie](https://www.oliveandmango.com/spiced-blueberry-pie/) and it also really works well with strawberry and rhubarb like in my [rhubarb crisp](https://www.oliveandmango.com/warm-vanilla-rhubarb-crisp/). Dessert couldn’t be more no-fuss than with this tart. It’s quicker to make than a pie and the fruit really shines in it. You just need to decide if it’s going to be ice-cream or whip cream over your slice. You know where I stand on that though. Its just as good with a little dusting of powdered sugar. Enjoy either way!

</br>

### Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 350°F and lightly grease and or line a 9-inch tart pan with a removable bottom or a 8x8 square brownie tin. Set aside.
2. In a medium bowl add berries, sugar, lemon juice and zest, and tapioca starch and toss until coated. Set aside while you prepare the crust.
3. In another medium sized bowl add the  almond flour, oats, sugar, baking powder, and salt and whisk until combined. Add the butter and vanilla and use your fingers or a pastry cutter to work it in until coarse crumbs form and the mixture holds together when pressed.
4. Remove and reserve approx &frac12; cup of the crumbs for the topping and empty the remaining crumbs into tart pan. Press the dough firmly and evenly into and up the sides of the pan.
5. Pour or spoon the berries over crust, with as little of the juices added. 
6. Sprinkle reserved crumble evenly over the top of the berries.
7. Bake for 40-45 minutes or until bubbling and golden. Check halfway through to see if you need to tent with foil to prevent topping from burning. Allow to cool completely before slicing and serving with a dollop of whip cream or ice-cream
8. Leftovers keep well for a couple of days in the refrigerator.

### Recipe Note

To make tart gluten free make sure to use GF old fashion oats. To make this tart vegan use vegan butter or coconut oil in place of the butter. You can replace the sugar for maple syrup or honey if you wish to use an alternative.
