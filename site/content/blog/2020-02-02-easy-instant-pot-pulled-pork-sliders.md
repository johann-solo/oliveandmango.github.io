These Easy Pulled Pork Sliders using the Instant Pot are super quick to whip up, full of flavor, and absolutely drool worthy. This is my very favourite pulled pork recipe that I have made many times from the Food Network. It can easily be made in the slow cooker using the same spice rub and just by reducing the amount of broth in the sauce ingredients. Using the slow cooker is wonderful but it’s not quick. It takes 8-10 hours on low or high for 3-4 hours. I decided to make it in the Instant Pot so that I could have a quicker version and I’m glad I did. It’s a great quick option.

Whichever way you decide to make them I know you will love them. Sliders are just the best way to use the pulled pork. They are perfect for parties, gatherings and even family dinners. I decided to keep them simple by topping them with dill pickles and cheese. You can serve them with coleslaw on the side and you have yourself a complete meal. Pickled onions also make for a great topping - anything pickled for that matter. I love the tangy brininess against the sweet and saucy pork.

I used brioche buns but any buns will do. I also used plain butter to brush the tops of the buns but you can add some seasoning to the butter if you would like to add some flavour to the buns themselves.  Any seasoning will do or even a little bit of garlic powder and sea salt will add some delicious flavour to the buns.

When they come out of the oven you get buttery crispy buns enveloping tender pulled saucy meat with a little cheese pull and some briny pickles. We can never get enough of pulled pork and this is the tastiest way to enjoy it. This recipe makes enough for some extra pulled pork to use up with some more buns or any leftovers would be great in tacos, a great breakfast addition to your omelette, also great in quesadillas or enchiladas too. It will keep for  3-4 days refrigerated and it also freezer well too. The meat is perfectly spiced and just the right amount of sweetness in a bbq sauce. It’s perfectly tender and delicious and I really hope you guys give it a try!

### Directions
__For the pulled pork__

1. Cut the pork shoulder into medium size pieces, about 2 inches each and place in a large bowl. In a small bowl combine all the dry spices and sprinkle over pork and toss. 

1. In a medium size bowl combine all the sauce ingredients together and whisk well and set aside 

1. Turn the Instant Pot to the Sauté setting and add the oil.  Once it’s hot enough and oil starts to shimmer add the pork pieces. Brown the pork for a couple of minutes each side (you may have to do this in two batches). Transfer the first batch to a plate and repeat with the second batch. Press cancel button on your Instant pot to turn off Sauté mode. 

1. Add all the meat back into the Instant Pot then pour the prepared sauce over the meat and toss and stir well scraping the bottom of the pot to loosen any brown bits.  There should be enough sauce to cover the meat. (If not add in a little extra broth until it does) Close the lid making sure it’s locked and set the Instant Pot to Pressure Cook for 60 minutes with a quick release. The cooker should take between 10 and 12 minutes to come up to pressure.

1. Once done carefully unlock and remove the lid from the instant pot. Using a slotted spoon, transfer all the pork to a bowl and using two forks start shredding the pork.
   
1. In the meantime switch the instant pot to the Sauté setting again with the lid off and simmer the leftover sauce until reduced by half, should take about 10-15 minutes. Skim off any fat and then ladle approx 2 cups of the reduced sauce to the pork and toss well.

__For the sliders__

1. Pre-heat oven to 375ᵒF
1. Arrange bottom half of rolls in medium baking dish. Spoon pulled pork evenly over top. Place dill pickle on each sandwich and lay cheese slices on top to cover all sandwiches.
1. Place tops on rolls and brush with melted butter. 
2. Bake at 375ᵒF for about 15 minutes until cheese is melted and top buns are slightly crisp.
