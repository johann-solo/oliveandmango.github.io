This Savoury Baked French Toast is loaded with caramelized onions, cheddar, and bacon all baked together in a casserole dish or the way I like it in a spring form pan... If you prefer savory over sweet when it comes to breakfast, this is definitely a recipe you will love.

It’s similar to a strata and a cross between a quiche, French toast and and omelette or frittata.  Just like a frittata, this baked fresh toast can really be made with any leftover bits of cheese and veggies but this is my all time favorite combination of add ins to it. The caramelized onions add a sweet and delicious note to it and I just can’t resist bacon and cheddar together. Those three ingredients can be switched up in so many ways. Ie- can you imagine how yummy this would be with chives, smoked salmon and dollops of cream cheese in the bake, how about onions sweet pepper and sun-dried tomatoes with a bit of ricotta or Parm? You see what I mean - so many options.

The 3 main ingredients that make this are eggs, milk, and bread. The rest you can play around with.  This is a classic combo that we love and know you will too! It’s really easy to throw together and fairly quick. The caramelized onions may take a bit of time but if I’m tight for time I like to make them while the bread is “soaking” and sprinkle them in once they have cooled and while placing the bread in the pan.

My hubby loves baked French toast. He always requests it on a long weekend.  I actually made this the last long weekend which was about 4 weeks ago and shared the recipe with my subscribers. I knew I was not going to be able to post it immediately so I sent it out early to them first. Well another long weekend is upon us and I’m still not feeling great after several days of being sick so no baked French toast this long long weekend. Taking the time to recoup and get ready for a long week of work ahead after it. There is still plenty of time for you to enjoy it so grab some bread, milk and eggs and get creative or try this tested combo out that we love - you too will  love it whether it’s for breakfast lunch or dinner.

## Recipe
### Ingredients 

* <span itemprop="ingredients"> 2 medium onions, halved and thinly sliced</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients"> 1 tablespoon butter</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients"> 1 tablespoon olive oil plus 1 tsp not for bacon if needed </span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients"> ½ teaspoon fresh thyme (or ¼ dried)</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients"> 300g bacon, diced</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients"> 6 eggs</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients"> 1&frac14; cups milk (full or low fat)</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients"> &frac14; tsp salt </span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients"> Black pepper to taste </span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients"> &frac12; tsp of mustard powder (optional) </span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients"> 7 cups (lightly packed) baguette or french stick cut into 2 cm / 1 inch cubes (day old preferably)</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients"> 2 cups grated cheddar cheese, divided </span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients"> Parsley, finely chopped to garnish </span>

### Directions

1. Heat butter and oil in a large sized pan or skillet over medium heat. Add the onions and let sauté for 5 minutes, stirring a couple times. 
2. Add the thyme and continue to cook for 20-25 minutes on medium low heat, stirring occasionally. If the onions start to caramelize too quickly, lower heat to the low setting. Once done scrape them into a separate bowl or plate and set aside to cool. 
3. In the the meantime cook the bacon using the same pan. Heat it over medium/high heat. (Add 1 tsp oil if needed and if pan is not non stick). Add all the bacon except 2 tbsp reserving that to top the French toast before baking, and cook the rest until lightly browned. Remove from the fry pan and drain on a paper towel.
4. In a large bowl whisk the eggs, milk, mustard powder, salt and pepper in a bowl.
5. Place the bread in a large ziplock bag. Pour in the egg mixture, 1&frac12; cups cheese and cooked bacon minus the 2 tbsp and the caramelized onions. Seal and massage the egg into the cubes. Set aside in the fridge for at least 30 minutes or overnight. Alternatively toss all the ingredients together in the bowl with the egg mixture and cover with plastic wrap before refrigerating.  
6. Once ready to bake preheat oven to 350°F.
7. Spray a 8-9 inch springform cake tin or a small to medium sized casserole dish (I love using the spring form). Pour the bread mixture into the cake tin, pat it down a little to compress and then sprinkle the remaining uncooked bacon and remaining &frac12; cup cheese over top. 
8. Cover loosely with foil and bake on a baking sheet for 30 minutes, then remove the foil and bake for a further 20 minutes or until bubbly, fluffy and golden. 
9. Remove from oven and allow it to rest for 5 minutes before removing the springform and cutting into slices to serve. Garnish with parsley and  black pepper.
