Individual strawberry shortcakes are one thing but a layered strawberry shortcake cake is another (it’s funny saying shortcake cake but that is what it is my friends) This is the best way to feed a crowd with a little less work and more reward, perfect for summertime entertaining. They bake up in no time meaning less oven time and made perfect using farm fresh berries that are so naturally sweet - no macerating needed. Although if you want your berries syrupy feel free to macerate or toss the berries with a &frac14; cup of sugar for an hour before assembling the cake. The sugar allows the release of all the natural juices from the berries making them syrupy and even sweeter. I love them just the way they are, but you can do either.

I decided to infuse my cream with basil. I was inspired after having the most delicious eclair while visiting Montreal last week. It was filled with a lemon basil cream that was just amazing. I had to recreate it for this strawberry dessert and because the two go hand in hand - both in season at the same time and in abundance.  I just shot something that requires a whole lot of basil so that is another reason I decided to give this infused basil cream a go. It was a total hit and I couldn’t stop spooning it in my mouth!  You will love it but if you wanted to keep this recipe simple just skip the basil Infusion. I thought I would just share it as an option.

## Recipe
Makes three 8 or 9 inch shortcakes and serves at least 8
</br>
</br>

### Ingredients 
__For the Filling__

* <span itemprop="ingredients">&frac14; Cup sugar</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">24 ounces of berries hulled and each sliced in four </span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">2 Cups heavy cream</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">1 Tsp. vanilla extract</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">20 large basil leaves (optional if making the basil cream) </span>

__For the Shortcakes__

* <span itemprop="ingredients">10 Tablespoons chilled unsalted butter, cut into small pieces plus more for  greasing the pans</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">3&frac12; Cups <span class="highlight"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.bobsredmill.com/gluten-free-1-to-1-baking-flour.html">Bob’s Red Mill Gluten Free 1 to 1 Baking Flour</a></span></span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">&frac12; Cup granulated sugar</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">1 Tbsp. baking powder</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">1 Tsp. baking soda</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">&frac14; Tsp. salt</span>
* <span itemprop="ingredients">1&frac34; Cups heavy cream</span>


### Directions

1.  If making the basil cream (if not continue to the next step) - bring 2 cups heavy cream to a gentle simmer in a small saucepan over medium heat. Bruise large basil leaves by hitting repeatedly with the dull side of a knife, and stir into cream. Remove from heat, cover tightly with plastic wrap, and let steep for 25 minutes. Strain through a fine sieve, pressing solids to extract liquid. Refrigerate until very cold, at least 5 hours.
2. Preheat oven to 375°F.
3. Grease insides of 3 (8 or 9 inch) round cake pans with butter and line the bottom with parchment paper 
4. Place the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a food processor and pulse a couple times to combine(or large bowl and whisk to combine).
5. Add the chilled butter and pulse (or cut in with a pastry blender) until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. 
6. Add heavy cream and pulse (or stir with a fork) just until moistened. Do not over mix/process. 
7. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface. Gather the dough into a large ball and gently knead until smooth, approximately 5 turns. Dough will be a little on the sticky side but that is ok. 
8. Divide the dough into 3 equal pieces. I used a scale to measure the dough so that each cake bakes the same  - but you can eye ball it too. 
9. Place each piece of dough into a prepared cake pan and with your hands press it into the pan spreading dough to edges and make it as smooth as possible, working quickly as it’s sticky and without overworking it. 
10. Bake cakes for approximately 20-25 minutes if using a 9 inch pan - 25-30 minutes if using an 8 inch pan or until golden. I usually start checking it at the 20 minute mark. 
11. Once done remove from oven and allow to cool in pan 5 minutes, then transfer to wire racks to cool completely. 

__Filling and Assembly__

1. Beat the heavy cream and vanilla extract with an electric mixer until soft peaks form.
1. Add the sugar while beating and continue to beat just until stiff peaks form. Do not over mix. 
1. Place one cake layer on a serving plate. 
1. Top evenly with approximately one third of the sliced strawberries. 
1. Pipe or spread (I usually pipe and then spread) evenly with about one third of whipped cream. 
1. Place the second cake layer on top of whipped cream. 
1. Top evenly with another third of strawberries and another third of whipped cream.
1. Place the final cake layer on top of whipped cream.
1. Spread with the last of the whip cream, leaving a 1-inch border around edges and top with remaining strawberries in a mound. Garnish with basil leaves and serve immediately.
