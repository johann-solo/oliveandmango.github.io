Stabilizing your whipped cream allows your whip cream to hold up and stay fresh looking longer and makes it easier to pipe and spread onto cakes and desserts. If you use plain whipping cream your deserts can look limp and the cream often starts to weep or get watery. Stabilizing your whipped cream helps with this and can elevate the look of your baked goods.

## How to stabilize whipped cream

There are actually several ways to do this. Simply adding certain ingredients to your whipping cream can add volume and stabilize it. The most popular ones being cornstarch, powdered sugar, pudding mix and even milk powder. But the one I use the most is gelatin. I find gelatin or agar agar for a vegan option works the best. A little goes a long way. A simple add in to create a whipped cream that pipes perfectly and spreads easily. This is a basic vanilla whip but you can easily stabilize any of your whip cream recipes by using the same measurement of a 1-1 ratio. 1 tsp of gelatin to 1 cup of whipping cream. Itâ€™s easy and works like a charm every time.

### Recipe
Makes 2 cups 
</br>

### Ingredients

* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 teaspoons water</span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 teaspoon unflavored gelatin</span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup cold heavy whipping cream</span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">&frac14; cup powdered sugar</span>
* <span itemprop="recipeIngredient">&frac12; teaspoon pure vanilla extract (or flavouring of choice) </span>

### Directions

1. Add the water to a small microwave safe bowl and sprinkle the unflavored gelatin on top. Allow to sit for a couple of minutes to bloom. 
2. Transfer the gelatin mixture to the microwave and microwave just a few seconds until the gelatin is fully dissolved and clear. Stir the mixture and set aside. Make just before adding to prevent it from sitting too long and setting. 
3. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, or in a large mixing bowl using an electric mixer, combine the heavy whipping cream, powdered sugar, and vanilla extract. Whip the mixture until it starts to thicken and soft peaks form, then turn the mixer to low speed. Add and stir in a tablespoon or two of whipped cream to the gelatin to equalize the temperature.
4. Slowly pour in the gelatin mixture until well combined. Increase the mixer to medium speed and continue mixing until stiff peaks form.
5. Pipe the whipped cream on your favorite dessert (or use it to frost it) and refrigerate your dessert until ready to serve.

### Recipe Notes

This whipped cream will hold up just fine at room temperature for a couple of hours, but it's best to keep your dessert refrigerated. It keeps in the fridge for 2-3 days if making ahead.
