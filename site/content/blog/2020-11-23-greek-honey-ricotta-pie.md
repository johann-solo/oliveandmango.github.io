<span class="blog-text">

This Greek honey ricotta pie (melopita) is made up of a simple, light and fluffy filling with a texture between a cheesecake and a baked custard. It’s traditionally made crust less but I decided to make it into a pie as I love my [honey pies](https://www.oliveandmango.com/salty-honey-pie/). Making it into a pie gives it extra texture in each bite with its buttery crisp crust. Its golden brown out the oven and served with extra honey spread on top and dusted with cinnamon.⁣

The word "melopita" basically translates as honey pie. Because this pie is sweetened with honey and then served with honey, it’s good to choose a wild blossom honey which has a richer flavour and adds so much more  to this pie. Feel free to use an infused one with this pie too if you have one you love like a lavender or citrus infused one. Choose one with a strong flavor that you like. I love serving mine with some honey comb over it. Not only does it help identify what kind of pie it is but it’s an extra treat to enjoy with the pie.

Although this is called a honey pie in Greek, its does feature cheese in it. The original recipe calls for anthotyro which is a soft, ricotta like cheese. Many other versions use a soft myzithra/mizithra cheese too. An easy substitute and one I often use is fresh ricotta. The filling will be as good as your ricotta is so make sure to choose a creamy rich ricotta to go into this pie.

When it comes to the original recipe for this honey ricotta pie, it’s naturally gluten free. I wanted to keep it that way when making it into a pie so I made a simple gluten free pie crust for it. I used <span class="highlight"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.bobsredmill.com/gluten-free-1-to-1-baking-flour.html">Bob’s Red Mill Gluten Free 1-to-1 Baking Flour</a></span> for the crust which is a straight 1-1 swap for all purpose flour. It’s a special 1-to-1 blend of gluten free flours,starches and xanthan gum. Perfect for quick breads like cookies, brownies and cakes and pies.  I took my favorite basic pie dough recipe and literally substituted the all purpose flour with Bob’s GF 1-1 one. 
</br>
</br>

The only difference when it comes to this GF pie dough is that you roll it out right after you make it. When I use all purpose flour I allow the dough to rest or fully hydrate in the fridge overnight. This particular dough behaves a little better or is a bit easier to roll out if done immediately. It rolls out quiet easily and nicely. Once I roll it out I fit it in my pie plate and crimp it and then I allow it to rest for 1 hour or overnight in the fridge before I bake it. It’s the perfect pie dough if you are looking for a gluten free alternative. It’s great for pies and also great for galettes or to top savoury pot pies with. It makes 2 pie dough discs, so I usually freeze one for another pie or galette.

This is a traditional Greek honey pie with a twist on the pie part. It’s only slightly different than the original recipe that hails from the island of Sifno but it’s just as delicious over a buttery flaky crust. It’s just the right sweetness if you are like me and prefer desserts that are more mildly sweet. We loved this light and creamy pie - now if only we can be transported to a Greek island...

### Directions

#### For the pie crust

1. Place flour, and sugar, in a food processor and pulse to combine
1. Add the cold butter over the flour and pulse until the mixture looks crumbly with larger, pea-sized chunks of butter. 
1. Drizzle apple cider vinegar in along with only ½ of the water. Pulse a few times or until dough mixture starts to come together and looks shaggy. Give the dough a pinch - if it sticks together, it’s ready. If not, drizzle in more water 1 tbsp at a time. You shouldn’t need to exceed the remaining &frac14; cup. 
1. Empty dough onto a lightly floured surface and shape into a ball. Divide the dough into 2 equal pieces and form each into a flat disk. (Wrap one tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate for up to 2 days or freeze until you need a pie crust, thaw in the refrigerator overnight before using.) 
1. Using wax or parchment paper, place one dough disc onto one sheet, flatten with palm, place another sheet on top and roll out to the desired size. Remove the top sheet and invert into pie pan peeling the second piece off after. 
1. Prick the bottom of pie with a fork a few times then refrigerate 30-60 min. (Or you can cover in plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight night or if wrapped well it can be frozen in the pie plate for up to 3 months. I usually refrigerate it first for 1 hour so that it’s stiff enough not to damage while wrapping it for the freezer.)
1. Preheat oven to 400°F
1. Place a piece of parchment paper or foil into pie plate over dough and fill with pie weights
1. Bake (par bake) at 400°F for 10 minutes then remove and brush the bottom and edges of crust with egg wash. And allow to cool while you make your filling.  

#### For the  filling

1. Place eggs and honey in a large mixing bowl and blend well with a mixer with a whisk attachment until pale in colour and fully. Them mix in the vanilla extract, lemon juice, corn starch and cinnamon.  Add the ricotta and mix until smooth. 
1. REDUCE oven temperature to 350°F Pour filling into pie crust and carefully transfer to oven and bake for an additional 25 - 35 minutes or until the filling is just set and middle of it still has a bit of jiggle. The top will be deeply golden. (Make sure to cover edges with foil or use a pie crust shield if edges are getting to golden)
1. Allow to cool completely on rack before slicing and serving 1-2 hours. Serve with a generous amount of extra honey and dusting of cinnamon. Leftovers can be wrapped and refrigerated for a few days. 
</br>

### Recipe Notes

* If the dough has been in the fridge for several hours, let it sit at room temperature until softened. If the dough immediately starts to crack once you start rolling, it’s too cold—give it a few more minutes to warm up. If the edges crack as you roll simply patch them as needed.
* To blind bake a single pie crust: Preheat the oven to 400˚F. Prick the bottom all over with a fork. Line the crust with a large piece of parchment paper then pour in dried beans or pie weights to completely cover the bottom. Bake 15-20 minutes. Remove the parchment and beans. Bake 5-10 minutes longer, or until light golden on the bottom. The crust can be blind baked up to 1 day in advance.
* This filling is mildly spiced. Feel free to increase the amount of vanilla extract or cinnamon in it according to taste. Or I will also often times add a shot of brandy for extra flavour.
